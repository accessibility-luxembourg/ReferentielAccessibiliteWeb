# Web Accessibility Assessment Framework (RAWeb) for Luxembourg

This repository contains the __reference files__ of the [RAWeb](https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/raweb1/index.html).


********************

The pages are organised as follows:

* [Introduction](./en/introduction.md)
* [Legal requirements](./en/obligations.md)
* Technical method
  * [Criteria and tests](./en/rgaa/criteres)
  * [Glossary](./en/rgaa/glossaire)
  * [Testing environment](./en/environnement-de-test.md)
  * [References](./en/references.md)
* Documentation
  * [Auditing kit](./kit-audit.md)
  * [Testing methodology](./methodologie-de-test.md)
  * [Changelog](./notes-de-revision.md)

The same content is also available in French, in the <code>/fr</code> folder.

The RAWeb files are available in Markdown format in the "rgaa" folder, they are notably compatible with the RGAA data structure.
They are also available in JSON format in the "json" folder with a structure similar to that of the RGAA. The criteria also have information about the mapping with En 301 549.
These files are generated by the scripts available in the "scripts" folder. These scripts are adapted from the [scripts available in the RGAA repository](https://github.com/DISIC/accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/tree/main/scripts).

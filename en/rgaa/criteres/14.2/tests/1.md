title: For each [accessibility feature](#accessibility-feature) described in the [documentation](#documentation), the [mechanism for enabling an accessibility feature](#mechanism-for-enabling-an-accessibility-feature) meets the accessibility needs of the users concerned. Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Identify the accessibility features described in the documentation. For example, you can 
	- access a version of the content in simplified language;
	- enlarge text size.
2. Check that the users concerned by each accessibility feature are able to access it. For example:
	- Alternative version in simplified language: the mechanism or set of mechanisms that enable the feature to be activated must be understandable and identifiable by a person who benefits from simplified language (for example, using the <a href="https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/easy-to-read/">"Easy to read" logo</a> to identify the mechanism is a compliant solution).
	- Larger font size: if the mechanism contains text, then the text must be displayed by default with a font size equivalent to 200% of the initial font size.
3. Check that it is possible to activate this feature.
4. If so, the test is validated.

title: Does each [real-time text communication](#real-time-text-communication) web application that can interact with other [real-time text communication](#real-time-text-communication) applications comply with the interoperability rules in force?

We recommend asking the application publisher to check that all the requirements described in criterion 6.2.3 Interoperability of European standard EN 301 549 are met.

title: For each [two-way voice communication web application](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application), is the application capable of encoding and decoding this communication with a frequency range whose upper limit is at least 7,000 Hz?

1. Activate the web application and launch a call between the two devices.
2. Check that the quality of oral activity with the web application is at least equivalent to the quality of oral activity during a call with a landline telephone.
3. If the test is unsatisfactory (e.g. poor understanding of certain words spoken by the caller, presence of extraneous noise, etc.), check the application documentation to ensure 
   1. the presence of a reference to the implementation of [ITU-T Recommendation G.722](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.722/en); 
   2. or the presence of a reference to the use of the [WebRTC API opus codec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs); 
   3. or the presence of a reference to the use of encoding and decoding with a frequency greater than or equal to 7,000 Hz.
4. Otherwise, it is recommended that you ask the application publisher to provide these technical details, in particular by asking whether the web application implements, for example, [ITU-T Recommendation G.722](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.722/en) or uses the [WebRTC API opus codec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs).
5. If this is the case, the test is validated.

title: On each web page, is each function that is usable or available through multi-touch also usable or available through a single point operation on the screen (excluding special cases).

1. Find in the document the features that can be used or made available by means of a multi-point touch interaction.
2. For each function, check that it is still available using touch interaction at a single point on the screen (for example, the ability to consult the items in a list using a horizontal right or left swipe should also be available using the "previous" and "next" buttons, or a pinch and zoom gesture that can be performed alternately using the "plus" and "minus" buttons).
3. If this is the case for each function that can be used or is available by means of multi-touch interactions, **the test is validated**.

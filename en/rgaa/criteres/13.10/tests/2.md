title: On each web page, is each function that is usable or available thanks to a path-based gesture on the screen also usable or available through a single point operation on the screen (excluding special cases)?

1. Find in the document the features that are usable or available by means of a touch interaction that involves following a particular path on the screen.
2. For each feature, check that it is still available by means of touch-type interaction at a single point on the screen (for example, the ability to enter a password by following a path on a virtual keyboard should also be available by means of successive presses on the keyboard keys).
3. If this is the case for each functionality that can be used or is available by means of touch interaction that involves following a particular path on the screen, **the test is validated**.

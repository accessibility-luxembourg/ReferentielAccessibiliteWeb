#### Technical note

When an image is associated with an [image caption](#image-caption), the WCAG Technical Note recommends systematically providing a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) (see Criterion 1.9). In this case, criterion 1.2 does not apply.

In the case of a decorative vector image (`<svg>` tag) which is displayed via an `<use href="â€¦">` element, which is a child of the `<svg>` element, test 1.2.4 will also apply to the associated `<svg>` element via the `<use>` element.

A WAI-ARIA `role="presentation"` attribute can be used on decorative images and decorative non-clickable areas. The `"none"` role introduced in ARIA 1.1 and synonymous with the `"presentation"` role can also be used. However, it is still preferable to use the `"presentation"` role while waiting for satisfactory support for the `"none"` role.

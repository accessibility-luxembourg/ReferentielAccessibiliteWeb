title: Does each [non-clickable](#non-clickable-area) [decoration area](#decorative-image) (`<area>` tag without `href` attribute), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<area>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and no other attribute to provide a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The `<area>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"` attribute.
---

1. Find in the document the decorative images implemented using an `<area>` element (without a `href` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<area>` element has no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it has
   - an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`);
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

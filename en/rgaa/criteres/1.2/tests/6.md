title: Does each [decorative](#decorative-image) embedded image (`<embed>` tag with `type="image/..."` attribute), without [image caption](#image-caption), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<embed>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
  - The `<embed>` tag and its children have no [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
---

1. Find in the document the decorative images without an image caption using an `<embed>` element (with a `type="image/..."` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<embed>` element does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute;
   - and has no text alternative;
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

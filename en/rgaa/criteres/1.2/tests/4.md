title: Does each [decorative](#decorative-image) vector image (`<svg>` tag), without [image caption](#image-caption), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<svg>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
  - The `<svg>` tag and its children have no [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The `<title>` and `<desc>` tags are missing or empty.
  - The `<svg>` tag and its children have no `title` attribute.
---

1. Find in the document the decorative images without an image caption, implemented using a `<svg>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<svg>` element has no `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute;
   - and has no text alternative (including its child elements);
   - and does not contain `<title>` and `<desc>` elements unless empty of content;
   - and has no `title` attribute (and its child elements).
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

title: Does each [decorative](#decorative-image) [object image](#object-image) (`<object>` tag with `type="image/..."` attribute), without [image caption](#image-caption), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<object>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
  - The `<object>` tag has no text alternative.
  - There is no alternative text between `<object>` and `</object>`.
---

1. Find in the document the  decorative images implemented without an image caption using an `<object>` element (with a `type="image/..."` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the opening `<object>` tag does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute;
   - and has no text alternative;
   - and has no alternative content between the `<object>` and `</object>` tags.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

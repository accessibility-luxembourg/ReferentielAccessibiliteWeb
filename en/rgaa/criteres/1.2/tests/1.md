title: Does each [decorative image](#decorative-image) (`<img>` tag), without [image caption](#image-caption), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<img>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and no other attribute to provide a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The `<img>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute or `role="presentation"`.
---

1. Find in the document the decorative images without a legend implemented using an `<img>` element.
2. For each image, check that the image has no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it has
   - an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`);
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

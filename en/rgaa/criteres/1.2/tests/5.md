title: Does each [decorative](#decorative-image) bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag), without [image caption](#image-caption), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<canvas>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
  - The `<canvas>` tag and its children have no [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - There is no text acting as a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>`.
---

1. Find in the document the decorative images without an image caption implemented using a `<canvas>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<canvas>` element has no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute;
   - and has no text alternative;
   - and has no alternative content between the `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

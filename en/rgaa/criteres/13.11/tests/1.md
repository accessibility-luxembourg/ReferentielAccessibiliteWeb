title: On each web page, do the actions triggered by a pointing device on a single point on the screen meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The action is triggered when the pointing device is [released](#released).
  - The action is triggered when the pointing device is [pressed](#pressed) then cancelled when the pointing device is [released](#released).
  - A mechanism is available to abort (before completion of the action) or cancel (after completion) the execution of the action.

1. Find in the document the actions triggered by a pointing device on a single point on the screen.
2. For each action, check that
   - either the action is triggered when the pointing device is released;
   - or the action is triggered when the pointing device is pressed or put down and then cancelled when the pointing device is released;
   - or there is a mechanism for aborting (before completion of the action) or cancelling (after completion) the execution of the action. For example, during a drag-and-drop interaction, releasing the pointing device should allow the current interaction to be aborted, and once the drop zone has been reached, the user should still be able to cancel the drop operation by means of a confirmation dialogue (choice of confirming or cancelling the drop) or by being able to return the dropped item to its initial position.
3. If this is the case for each action triggered by a pointing device on a single point on the screen, **the test is validated**.

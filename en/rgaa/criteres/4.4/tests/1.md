title: For each pre-recorded synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) with synchronised [captions](#synchronised-captions-media-object), does at least one caption track meet these conditions?
steps:
- The captions are in the language of the video;
- The captions are relevant;
- The captions are correctly synchronised. 
---

1. Find the synchronised time-based media with captions in the document.
2. For each synchronised time-based media, check that the captions are:
	- in the language of the video (if the spoken content is in English, the captions must be in English); 
	- relevant (all important audio information is present, particularly dialogue);
	- correctly synchronised. If there is no delay between the spoken content and the appearance of the captions, the captions are correctly synchronised. The reference standard specifies that captions should appear within 100 ms of the [caption time stamp](#time-stamp).
3. If this is the case for each synchronised time-based media, **the test is validated**.

title: Do [related form controls](#related-form-controls) meet any of these conditions, if necessary?
steps:
  - The [related form controls](#related-form-controls) are grouped together in a `<fieldset>` tag.
  - The [related form controls](#related-form-controls) are grouped together in a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="group"` attribute.
  - The [related form controls](#related-form-controls) of radio type (`<input type="radio">`) or tags with a WAI-ARIA `role="radio"` attribute) are grouped together in a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="radiogroup"` or `role="group"` attribute.

1. Find the related form controls in the document (for example, a group of identity information entries, a series of tick boxes, a date entry in several successive fields, etc.).
2. For each group of form related form controls, check that these related form controls are grouped together:
   - either in a `<fieldset>` element;
   - or in an element with a WAI-ARIA `role="group"` attribute;
   - or in an element with a WAI-ARIA `role="radiogroup"` or `"group"` attribute, in the case of `<input>` elements of type `radio` (or elements with a WAI-ARIA `role="radio"` attribute).
3. If this is the case for each group of form related form controls, **the test is validated**.

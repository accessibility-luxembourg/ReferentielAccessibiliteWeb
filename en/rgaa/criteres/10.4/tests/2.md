  - When using the browser's graphical zoom functions.
  - When using a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) specific to the site which allows the text to be enlarged or zoomed.

   - The browser's graphical zoom is set to 200%.
   - The personalised zoom functions offered by the document are used.
2. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

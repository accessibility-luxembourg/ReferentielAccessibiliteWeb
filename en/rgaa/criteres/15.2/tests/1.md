title: Does each [editing tool](#editing-tool) provide [help with creating accessible content](#help-with-creating-accessible-content) that complies with the [digital accessibility rules](#digital-accessibility-rules)?
---

1. Identify in the tool the presence of aids for creating accessible content. This could be 
	- automatic or semi-automatic tests available from the editing functions;
	- other automatic tools (a chatbot, for example);
	- documentation that explains how to define accessibility properties for each content item;
	- manual tests available from the editing functions to guide authors in detecting errors.
2. Check that the help with creating accessible content is relevant, i.e. that the results or indications it gives can be used to create accessible content.
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.

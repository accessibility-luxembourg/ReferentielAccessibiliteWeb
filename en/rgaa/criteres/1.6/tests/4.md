title: Does each [button](#button-form) of the image type (`<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) containing a reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute associating a [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) acting as [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).

1. Find in the document the `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute, which contain information requiring a detailed description.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that there is
   - either a text alternative containing a reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - a link or adjacent button giving access to the detailed description;
   - or a WAI-ARIA attribute aria-describedby associating a passage of text acting as a detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, **the test is validated**.

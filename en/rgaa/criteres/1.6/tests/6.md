title: For each vector image (`<svg>` tag) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), having a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), is any reference to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) in the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute and the associated [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) in the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute correctly rendered (by assistive technologies)?

1. Find in the document the `<svg>` elements conveying information for which a detailed description is provided using an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
2. For each `<svg>` element, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
3. If this is the case for each `<svg>` element, **the test is validated**.

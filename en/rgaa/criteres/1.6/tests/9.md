title: For each image (`<img>`, `<input>` tags with the `type="image"` attribute, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` tags, or tags having a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which is accompanied by a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) and which uses a WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute, does the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute associate the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image)?
---

1. Find in the document the images (`<img>`, `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` elements, or elements possessing a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) conveying information whose detailed description uses a WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute.
2. For each image, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

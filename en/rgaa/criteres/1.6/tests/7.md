title: Does each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag), [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute containing the text alternative and a reference to an adjacent [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute associating a passage of text acting as a text alternative and another acting as a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is text content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` referring to a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) adjacent to the bitmap image.
  - There is text content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` that acts as a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).

1. Find in the document the `<canvas>` elements conveying information that require a detailed description.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, check that there is
   - either a WAI-ARIA aria-label attribute containing the text alternative and a reference to an adjacent detailed description;
   - or a WAI-ARIA aria-labelledby attribute associating a passage of text acting as a text alternative and another acting as a detailed description;
   - or a text content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` referring to a detailed description adjacent to the bitmap image;
   - or a text content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` acting as a detailed description;
   - or an adjacent link or button giving access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<canvas>` element, **the test is validated**.

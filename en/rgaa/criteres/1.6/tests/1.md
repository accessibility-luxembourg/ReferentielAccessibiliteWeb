title: Does each image (`<img>` tag) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) containing a reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
---

1. Find in the document the images that are implemented using an `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) and conveying information that requires a detailed description.
2. For each image, check that there is
   - Either a text alternative containing a reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - Or a link or adjacent button giving access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

title: Does each [object image](#object-image) (`<object>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) containing a reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
---

1. Find in the document the `<object>` elements with the `type="image/..."` attribute, which contain information requiring a detailed description.
2. For each `<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, check that there is
   - either a text alternative containing a reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - or an adjacent link or button giving access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, **the test is validated**.

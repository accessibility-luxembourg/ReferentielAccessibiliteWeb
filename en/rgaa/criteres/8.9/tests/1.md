title: In every web page, tags (with the exception of `<div>`, `<span>` and `<table>`) must not be used [only for layout purposes](#only-for-layout-purposes). Is this rule respected?

1. Find in the document all the semantic elements used for presentation purposes
2. For each of these elements, check that
   - The element has a `role="presentation"` attribute.
   - The use of this element for presentation purposes remains justified.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

Note: Here are a few non-exhaustive examples of markup misuse: a `<div>` element used as a paragraph, a heading used as a legend, a `<blockquote>` element or empty paragraphs or even spaces used to create margin effects.
The use of a `role="presentation"` is formally discouraged, but may be justified in rare cases. This may be acceptable on a `<blockquote>` element or an empty paragraph, but will be considered non-compliant on a heading.

Tables: note that this test deals with presentation tables, which should not appear in the Tables theme.

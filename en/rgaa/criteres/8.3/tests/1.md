title: For each web page, does the default language meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The page language indication (`lang` and/or `xml:lang` attribute) is given for the `html` element.
  - The language of the page (`lang` and/or `xml:lang` attribute) is given for each text element or for one of the parent elements.
---

1. Find the default language indication in the document.
2. Check for the presence of a language indication
   - either using the lang attribute on the html tag if the code is HTML5 or HTML4;
   - or using the lang and xml:lang attributes on the html tag if the code is XHTML 1.0;
   - or using the xml:lang attribute on the html tag if the code is XHTML 1.1;
   - otherwise, check for the presence of a language indication on each text element or one of its parents.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

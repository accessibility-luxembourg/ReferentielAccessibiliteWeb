title: Does each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) satisfy, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media).
---

1. Find in the document the pre-recorded video-only time-based media that require an audio description.
2. For each video-only time-based media, check for the presence of
   - either an audio description;
   - or an alternative version with an audio description accessible via a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor).
3. If this is the case for video-only time-based media, **the test is validated**.

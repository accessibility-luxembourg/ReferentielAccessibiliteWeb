title: Is each [template](#template) that makes it possible to comply with the [digital accessibility rules](#digital-accessibility-rules) clearly identifiable?
---

1. Identify the presence of templates that fully comply with the digital accessibility rules provided by the editing tool.
2. Check that they are clearly marked so that they can be identified. For example, in the list of templates, compliant templates will have an "accessible template" label.
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.

title: For each audio only, video only or synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised), does the adjacent text content clearly identify the [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) (excluding special cases)?

1. Find in the document the pre-recorded time-based media (video, audio or synchronised only).
2. For each time-based media, check that a passage of text (a heading or paragraph, for example) immediately preceding or following the time-based media enables it to be identified.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

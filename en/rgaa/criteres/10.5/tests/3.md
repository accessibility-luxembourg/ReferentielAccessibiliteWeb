title: On every web page, is every use of an image to create a background colour for an element likely to contain text, via CSS (`background`, `background-image`), accompanied by a background colour declaration (`background`, `background-color`), at least, inherited from a parent?
---

1. Find text in the document whose background is an image (`background-image` property).
2. Identify the element containing the text and check that if the background image is missing, the text is still legible.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, is each CSS declaration of font colour (`color`), of an element likely to contain text, accompanied by at least one declaration of background colour (`background`, `background-color`), inherited from a parent?

1. Find coloured text in the document, with the exception of default colours (e.g. links, etc.).
2. Identify the element containing the text and check that there is a calculated value for the element's `background-color` property.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

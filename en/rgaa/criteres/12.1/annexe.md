#### Special cases

There is a special case management when the website consists of a single page or a very limited number of pages (see note). In this case, the criterion does not apply.

The criterion also does not apply to pages in a set of web pages that are the result of a process or part of a process (a payment or order process, for example).

Note: the assessment of a very limited number of pages should be reserved for a site where all the pages can be reached from the home page.

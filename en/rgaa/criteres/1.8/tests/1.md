title: In the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), each [image of text](#image-of-text) (`<img>` tag or tag having a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) must, if possible, be replaced by [styled text](#styled-text). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the images of text implemented using an `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that:
   - either a replacement mechanism exists;
   - or the image contains text which uses a graphic effect which cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

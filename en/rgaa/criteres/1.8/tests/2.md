title: In the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), each "[image of text](#image-of-text)" button (`<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) must, if possible, be replaced by [styled text](#styled-text). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the "image of text" buttons (`<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - or the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

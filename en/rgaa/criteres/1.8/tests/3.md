title: In the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), each [image of text](#image-of-text) object (`<object>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) must, if possible, be replaced by [styled text](#styled-text). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the image of text objects (`<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute).
2. For each image, check that
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - or the image contains text which uses a graphic effect which cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

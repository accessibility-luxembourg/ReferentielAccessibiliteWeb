title: Does every [script](#script) that initiates a [change of context](#changes-of-context) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The user is notified by text of the script's action and the type of change before it is triggered.
  - The change of context is initiated by an explicit button (input of type `submit`, `button` or `image`, or `<button>` tag).
  - The change of context is initiated by an explicit link.

1. Find all the JavaScript events in the document which initiate a change of context, for example
   - dynamic updating of form fields;
   - the opening of a new page when an option in a combobox is activated (`<select>` element);
   - AJAX updating of an essential part of the page;
   - automatic launch of a video player when a playlist is selected;
   - focus manipulation to change the user's current position on the page.
2. Check that
   - the user is warned by a message about the script action and the type of change before it is triggered;
   - or the change of context is initiated by an explicit button (input of the submit, button or image type or the button tag);
   - or the change of context is initiated by an explicit link.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

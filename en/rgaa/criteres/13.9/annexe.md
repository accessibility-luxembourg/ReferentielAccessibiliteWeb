#### Special cases

There are some interfaces for which the orientation of the device is essential to their use.

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable. These may include interfaces for playing games, playing the piano, depositing bank cheques, etc.

If the interface is the only means of accessing the proposed service, an alternative should be put in place to compensate for this deficiency.

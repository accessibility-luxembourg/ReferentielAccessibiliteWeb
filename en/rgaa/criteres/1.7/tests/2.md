title: Does each [button](#button-form) of image type (`<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute), [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), having a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), check these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) on the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The passage of text linked by the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

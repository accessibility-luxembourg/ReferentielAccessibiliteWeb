title: Does each image (`<img>` tag) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), with a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) on the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The passage of text linked by the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the images that are implemented using an `<img>` element and have a detailed description.
2. For each image, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

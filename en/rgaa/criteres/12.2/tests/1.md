2. Visually compare the two pages and check that the menu and navigation bars are always at the same place in the layout.
3. Compare the source code (generated on the client side) of the two pages and check that the menu and navigation bars are always in the same relative order in the structure.
4. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

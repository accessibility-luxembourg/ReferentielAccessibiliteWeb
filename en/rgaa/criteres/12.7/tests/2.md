1. Find in the document the main content region (indicated by the visible main element).
2. Check that the bypass or skip link to the zone is
   - located at the same place in the presentation;
   - always present in the same relative order in the source code (generated on the client side);
   - visible when focused during tabbing;
   - functional.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

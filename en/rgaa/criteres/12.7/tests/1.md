title: On each web page, is there a link to avoid the [main content region](#main-content-region) or to access it (excluding special cases)?

1. Find in the document the main content region (indicated by the visible main content element).
2. Check that the zone
   - either can be avoided using a skip link directly preceding the zone in the source code order;
   - or can be reached by means of a quick access link visible when focused by tabbing.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

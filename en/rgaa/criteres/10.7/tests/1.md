1. Find in the document the elements which are likely to receive the focus (interface elements such as links or form controls, as well as any element with a `tabindex` attribute with a value equal to or greater than 1).
2. For each element likely to receive the focus, check that the visual indication of when the focus is taken is present (by acting on the outline or background or both) and is sufficiently contrasted (contrast ratio equal to or greater than 3:1).
3. If this is the case for each element likely to receive the focus, **the test is validated**.

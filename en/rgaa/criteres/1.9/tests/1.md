title: If necessary, does each image with an [image caption](#image-caption) (`<img>`, `<input>` tags with the `type="image"` attribute or with a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute associated with an adjacent [image caption](#image-caption)) meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The image (`<img>`, `<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute or tag having a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) and its adjacent [image caption](#image-caption) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `role="figure"` or `role="group"` attribute.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [image caption](#image-caption).
  - The [image caption](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.

1. In the document, find the images with a legend implemented using the `<img>` element, an `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA property `role="figure"` or `role="group"`;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

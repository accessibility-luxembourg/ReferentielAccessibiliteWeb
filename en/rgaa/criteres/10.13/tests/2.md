title: Can any additional content that appears when hovering over a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) be hovered over with the mouse pointer without disappearing (except in special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the additional content that becomes visible when a user interface component is hovered over, with the exception of
   - additional content controlled by the user agent (for example, tooltips associated with the title attribute or the native validation of a form);
   - additional content that becomes visible when activated by the user (for example, a dialog window).
2. For each additional content item, check that it can be hovered over with the mouse pointer without disappearing.
3. If this is the case for each additional content item, **the test is validated**.

title: Does each additional content that appears when focused or when hovering over a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The additional content remains visible until the user removes the mouse pointer or the focus from the additional content and from the [user interface component](#user-interface-component) that triggered its appearance.
  - The additional content remains visible until the user triggers an action that hides this content without moving the focus or mouse pointer of the [user interface component](#user-interface-component) that triggered its appearance.
  - The additional content remains visible until it is no longer valid.

1. Find in the document additional content which becomes visible when the focus is set or when a user interface component is hovered over, with the exception of
   - additional content controlled by the user agent (for example, tooltips associated with the `title` attribute or the native validation of a form);
   - additional content that becomes visible when activated by the user (for example, a dialog window).
2. For each additional content item, check that it remains visible
   - until the user removes the mouse pointer or focus from the additional content or user interface component that triggered its appearance;
   - until the user triggers the mechanism provided to make the additional content disappear;
   - until the information provided by the additional content is no longer valid (for example, additional content indicating the "busy" state of the user interface component that the user wishes to activate, or an error message in the form of additional content until the user rectifies their input).
3. If this is the case for each additional content item, **the test is validated**.

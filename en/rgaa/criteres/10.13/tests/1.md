title: Can any additional content that becomes visible when focused or hovering over a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) be hidden by a user action without moving the focus or mouse pointer (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document any additional content that becomes visible when the user focuses or hovers over a user interface component, with the exception of
   - Additional content controlled by the user agent (for example, tooltips associated with the `title` attribute or the native validation of a form.
   - Additional content that becomes visible when activated by the user (for example, a dialog window).
2. For each additional content item, check that
   - Either the additional content is positioned in such a way that it does not interfere with the viewing of other information content on which it is superimposed (including the user interface component that triggered its appearance), whatever the viewing conditions (including when using a zoom mechanism).
   - Or a mechanism (on the keyboard) can be used to make the additional content disappear (for example, the Escape key).
3. If this is the case for each additional content item, **the test is validated**.

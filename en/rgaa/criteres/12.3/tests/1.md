title: Is the [site map page](#site-map-page) representative of the overall architecture of the site?
---

1. Check that the site map is representative of the general architecture of the site (see note).
2. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

Note: A site map that is too complex or too deep is not recommended as an aid to navigation. Not all pages need to be included in the site map if they can be reached, for example, from the home page of a section or catalogue.

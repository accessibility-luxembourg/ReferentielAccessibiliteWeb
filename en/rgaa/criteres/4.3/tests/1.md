title: Does each pre-recorded synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) meet, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) has [captions](#synchronised-captions-media-object).
  - There is an alternative version with [captions](#synchronised-captions-media-object) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
---

1. Find the synchronised pre-recorded time-based media in the document.
2. For each synchronised time-based media, check for the presence of
   - either captions;
   - or an alternative version with captions accessible via a link or adjacent button.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

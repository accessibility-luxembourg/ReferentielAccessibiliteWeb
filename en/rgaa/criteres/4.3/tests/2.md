title: For each pre-recorded synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) with synchronised [captions](#synchronised-captions-media-object) broadcast via a `<track>` tag, does the `<track>` tag have a `kind="captions"` attribute?
---

1. Find the synchronised time-based media with captions in the document using a `<track>` element.
2. For each synchronised time-stream, check that the `<track>` tag has a `kind="captions"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each synchronised time-based media, **the test is validated**.

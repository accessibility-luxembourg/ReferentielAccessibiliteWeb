title: In the [mechanism for displaying a compliant contrast ratio](#mechanism-for-displaying-a-compliant-contrast-ratio), is the contrast ratio between the text and the background colour high enough?
---

1. Find the mechanisms used to display a compliant contrast ratio in the document.
2. For each of these mechanisms, check that the contrast ratio between the text and the background colour is sufficiently high.
3. If this is the case for each mechanism, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, do texts and images of texts without bold effects with a rendered size of less than 24px meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [contrast](#contrast) ratio between the text and its background is at least 4.5:1.
  - A mechanism allows the user to display text with a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of at least 4.5:1.

1. Find in the document texts and images of texts with no bold effect and a rendered size of less than 24px that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these texts, check that
   - either the contrast ratio between the text and its background is 4.5:1, at least;
   - or a mechanism allows the user to display the text with a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
3. If this is the case for each text, **the test is validated**.

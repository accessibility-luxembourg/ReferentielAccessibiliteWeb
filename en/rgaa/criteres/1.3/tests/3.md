title: For each [button](#button-form) of type `image` (`<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute), having a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the value of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute and a text alternative (image).
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that the text alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

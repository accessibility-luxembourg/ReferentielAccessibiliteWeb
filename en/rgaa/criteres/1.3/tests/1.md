title: For each image (`<img>` tag or tag with WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), having a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the value of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) linked by `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the images implemented using an `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) with a text alternative (image).
2. For each image, check that the text alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

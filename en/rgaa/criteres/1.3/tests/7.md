title: For each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), having an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) or an [alternative content](#alternative-content), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the value of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [alternative content](#alternative-content) is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<canvas>` elements that have an alternative text.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, check that the text alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

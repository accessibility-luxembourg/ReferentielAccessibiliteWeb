title: For each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) and having an [alternative content](#alternative-content) between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>`, is this [alternative content](#alternative-content) [correctly rendered (by assistive technologies)](#correctly-rendered-by-assistive-technologies)?
---

1. Find in the document the `<canvas>` elements with alternative content between the `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, check that the alternative content is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

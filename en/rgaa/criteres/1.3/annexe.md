#### Special cases

There are special considerations when the image is used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha) or as a [test image](#test-image). In this case, where it is not possible to provide a relevant alternative without destroying the object of the CAPTCHA or test, the criterion is not applicable.

Note: the case of CAPTCHAs and test images is addressed specifically in criterion 1.4.

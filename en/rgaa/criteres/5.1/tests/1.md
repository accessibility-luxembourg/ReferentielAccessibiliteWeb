title: For each [complex data table](#complex-data-table), is a [summary](#summary-of-table) available?
---

1. Find in the document the complex data tables (data table - `<table>` element or element with a WAI-ARIA `role="table"` attribute - containing headers which are not distributed only on the first row and/or the first column of the grid or whose scope is not valid for the whole column or row).
2. For each complex data table, check that there is a passage of text explaining the nature and structure of the table:
   - either in the `<caption>` element;
   - or in the `summary` attribute of the `<table>` element (in versions of HTML and XHTML prior to HTML 5);
   - or in a passage of text linked to the table with the `aria-describedby` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each complex data table, **the test is validated**.

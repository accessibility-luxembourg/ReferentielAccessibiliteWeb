title: Does each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) and [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) that has a [compatible with assistive technologies](#compatible-with-assistive-technologies) alternative meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The alternative is adjacent to [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) or [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media).
  - The alternative can be accessed via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a mechanism for replacing [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) or [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) with its alternative.

1. Find the time-based and non-time-based media in the document that have an alternative compatible with assistive technologies.
2. For each media, check that
   - either the alternative is adjacent to the time-based or non-time-based media;
   - either the alternative is accessible via a link or an adjacent button;
   - or there is a mechanism for replacing the time-based or non-time-based media with its alternative.
3. If this is the case for each time-based or non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.

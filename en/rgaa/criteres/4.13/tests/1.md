title: Does each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) and [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The name, role, value, settings and status changes of user interface components are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API.
  - An alternative [compatible with an accessibility API](#compatible-with-assistive-technologies) provides access to the same accessibility features.

1. Find the non-time-based and time-based media in the document.
2. For each media, check that:
   - either the name, role, value, settings and status changes of the user interface components are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API (for example, dynamically updated zones in a video player are correctly rendered);
   - or an alternative compatible with an accessibility API can be used to access the same accessibility features.
3. If this is the case for each time-based or non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.

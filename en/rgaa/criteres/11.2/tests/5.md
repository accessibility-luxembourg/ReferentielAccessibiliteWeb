title: Does every [form input field](#form-input-field) with a [visible label](#visible-label) meet these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute of the [form input field](#form-input-field) contains at least the [visible label](#visible-label).
  - If present, the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) linked to the [form input field](#form-input-field) via a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute contains at least the [visible label](#visible-label).
  - If present, the value of the `title` attribute of the [form input field](#form-input-field) contains at least the [visible label](#visible-label).
  - If present, the content of the `<label>` tag associated with the [form input field](#form-input-field) contains at least the [visible label](#visible-label).

1. Find in the document the form fields whose label is provided both by a visible label and by the content of either a `<label>` element, or a `title` attribute or a `aria-label` attribute or a `aria-labelledby` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that the content of the `<label>` element or the `title` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute or the `aria-labelledby` attribute contains the visible label.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.

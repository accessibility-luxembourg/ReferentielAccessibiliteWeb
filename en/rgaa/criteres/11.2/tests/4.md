title: Does each [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute reveal the exact function of the [form input field](#form-input-field) with which it is associated?
---

1. Find in the document the form fields whose label is provided by a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that the content of the referenced passage of text is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.

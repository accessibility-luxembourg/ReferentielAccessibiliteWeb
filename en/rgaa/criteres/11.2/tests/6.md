title: Does each button adjacent to the [form input field](#form-input-field) that provides a visible label identify the exact function of the [form input field](#form-input-field) with which it is associated?
---

1. Find the form fields in the document whose visible label is provided by an adjacent button.
2. For each form field, check that the visible content of the button is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.

title: For each [two-way voice communication web application](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application) that has [voice-based services](#voice-based-services), can these be used without the need to listen or speak?
---

1.	Identify the functions available in the web application (apart from the oral communication function) that are based on listening to information or issuing commands, for example 
	- voicemail;
	- an automatic switchboard (e.g. one that requires you to say a number between 1 and 4 to be redirected to a service);
	- or any other interactive voice server.
2.	Check that: 
	- the information is available without having to listen or speak (e.g. using a transcript or chat system);
	- the actions can be carried out without having to listen or speak, or that there is an alternative to the functionality that can be used without having to listen or speak.
3.	If this is the case, the test is validated.

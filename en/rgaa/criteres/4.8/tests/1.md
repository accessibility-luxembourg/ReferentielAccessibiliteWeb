title: Does each [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) satisfy, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - A clearly identifiable [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) leads to a page containing an alternative.
  - A clearly identifiable [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) leads to an alternative on the page.
---

1. Find all non-time-based media in the document.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that a clearly identifiable adjacent link or button
   - either contains the address (url) of a page containing an alternative;
   - or provides access to an alternative on the page.
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.

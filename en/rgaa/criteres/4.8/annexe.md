#### Special cases

There are special considerations when:

- [Non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) is used for decorative purposes (i.e. it does not provide any information);
- [Non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) is broadcast in a controlled environment;
- [Non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) is inserted via JavaScript, checking the presence and version of the plug-in, to replace [alternative content](#alternative-content) already present.

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable.

title: Does each group of [related form controls](#related-form-controls) have a [legend](#legend)?
---

1. Find the groups of related form controls in the document.
2. For each group of related form controls, check that
   - If the grouping uses a `<fieldset>` element, the `<fieldset>` element has a `<legend>` element.
   - If the grouping element uses a WAI-ARIA `role="group"` or `"radiogroup"` attribute, it has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.
3. Otherwise, for each of the related form controls, check for the presence of
   - either a title attribute to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping;
   - or an `aria-label` attribute to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping;
   - or an `aria-labelledby` attribute which references a passage of text used to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping;
   - or an `aria-describedby` attribute which references a passage of text used to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping;
4. If this is the case for each group of form fields or for each of the related form controls, **the test is validated**.

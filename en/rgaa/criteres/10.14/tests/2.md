title: On each web page, does the additional content appearing in the focus of a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) via CSS styles respect one of these conditions if necessary?
steps:
  - Additional content also appears when the component is activated using the keyboard and any pointing device.
  - Additional content also appears when the component is hovered over.
  - Additional content also appears when another component is activated or hovered over.
---

1. Find in the document the additional content that becomes visible when the focus of a user interface component is activated using a CSS mechanism (pseudo-class `:focus`).
2. For each additional content item, check that the additional content also appears:

- When the component is activated using the keyboard or any other pointing device.
- When the component is hovered over.
- When another component is activated or hovered over.

3. If this is the case for each additional content item, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, does the additional content appearing on hovering over a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) via CSS styles respect one of these conditions, if necessary?
steps:
  - The additional content also appears when the component is activated via the keyboard and any pointing device.
  - Additional content also appears when the component is focused.
  - Additional content also appears when the focus of another component is activated or focused.
---

1. Find additional content in the document that becomes visible when a user interface component is hovered using a CSS mechanism (`pseudo-class :hover`).
2. For each additional content, check that the additional content also appears
   - When the component is activated using the keyboard or any other pointing device.
   - When the component is focused.
   - When another component is activated or focused.
3. If this is the case for each additional content item, **the test is validated**.

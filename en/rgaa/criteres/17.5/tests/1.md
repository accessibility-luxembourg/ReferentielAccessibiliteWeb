title: For each [two-way voice](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application) and [real-time text](#real-time-text-communication) communication web application, is there a visual indicator of oral activity?
---

1. Check that the web application allows two-way voice communication and real-time text (RTT) communication.
2. If this is the case, activate the web application on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
3. Have a user speak from one of the terminals.
4. Check that a visual indicator appears on the interface to identify that a person is speaking. It is not necessary for this criterion to identify who is speaking, but simply to identify that there is a person speaking. For example, a halo around or an icon near the avatar of the person speaking.
5. If this is the case, the test is validated.

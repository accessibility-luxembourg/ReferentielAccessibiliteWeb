title: For each [two-way voice communication web application](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application) that has real-time video, is there a visual indicator of speaking activity?
---

1. Check that the web application allows two-way voice communication and real-time video streaming.
2. If this is the case, activate the application on two devices and connect them to the same session.
3. Have a user speak from one of the devices.
4. Check that a visual indicator appears on the interface to identify that a person is speaking. It is not necessary for this criterion to identify who is speaking, but simply to identify that there is a person speaking. For example, a halo around or an icon near the avatar of the person speaking.
5. If this is the case, the test is validated.

title: Does each [form input field](#form-input-field) whose object relates to information about the user meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [form input field](#form-input-field) has an `autocomplete` attribute;
  - The `autocomplete` attribute has a value in the [list of possible values for the `autocomplete` attribute](#list-of-possible-values-for-the-autocomplete-attribute) associated with a [form input field](#form-input-field).
  - The value indicated for the `autocomplete` attribute is relevant to the type of information expected.

1. Find in the document the form fields which relate to information about the user (surname, first name, telephone number, etc.).
2. For each form field, check that
   - The form field has an `autocomplete` attribute.
   - The `autocomplete` attribute has a value from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="list of possible values - new window" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#autofill-processing-model">list of possible values</a>.
   - The value indicated for the `autocomplete` attribute is relevant to the type of information expected.
3. If this is the case for each form field found, **the test is validated**.

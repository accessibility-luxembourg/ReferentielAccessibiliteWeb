title: On every web page, every text whose reading direction is different from the default [reading direction](#reading-direction) is contained in a tag with a `dir` attribute
---

1. Find in the document passages of text that use a language that is read in the opposite direction to the document language (such as Arabic or Hebrew for French, for example).
2. For each passage of text, check that the passage of text is contained in a tag which has a `dir` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each passage of text, **the test is validated**.

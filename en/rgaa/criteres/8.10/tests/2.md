title: On each web page, does each change of [reading direction](#reading-direction) (`dir` attribute) check these conditions?
steps:
  - The value of the `dir` attribute conforms (`rtl` or `ltr`)
  - The value of the `dir` attribute is relevant.
---

1. For each passage of text validated in test 8.10.1, check that
   - The reading direction is correct (ltr, for the direction "left to right" and rtl for the direction "right to left")
   - The reading direction is relevant.
2. If this is the case for each passage of text, **the test is validated**.

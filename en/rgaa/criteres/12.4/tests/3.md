title: In each [set of web pages](#set-of-web-pages), is the functionality to the [site map page](#site-map-page) always in the same relative order in the source code?

1. Choose a page from the sample that belongs to the same set of web pages as the page being audited.
2. Compare the source code (generated on the client side) of the two pages and check that the means of access to the site map is always at the same place in the structure (in relation to the relative order of the page elements, for example it is always at the top of the page).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: Does each identification or control feature that relies on the use of [biological characteristics](#biological-characteristics) of the user comply with one of these conditions?
steps:
- There is an alternative that does not rely on a biological characteristic of the user.
- An alternative exists that is based on a biological characteristic of the user that is sufficiently different from the biological characteristic initially requested.
---
1. Find the identification (authentication) and control functions on the page that use biological characteristics (voice recognition, fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.).
2. Check that there is an alternative method of performing the action: 
	- For an authentication feature that uses fingerprint recognition, a button is available on the login page to access password entry.
	- For an authentication function that uses voice recognition, the website also offers fingerprint recognition.
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.

If the alternative method also relies on a biological characteristic, it is essential that it does not use a similar biological characteristic. For example, if the initial method is based on voice, the alternative method must not use voice.

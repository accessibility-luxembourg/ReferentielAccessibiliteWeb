title: On each web page, the tags used for the [presentation of information](#presentation-of-information) must not be present in the generated source code of the pages. Is this rule respected?

1. Check that the `<basefont>`, `<big>`, `<blink>`, `<center>`, `<font>`, `<marquee>`, `<s>`, `<strike>`, `<tt>` presentation elements are not present.
2. Check for the absence of the `<u>` element only if the DOCTYPE of the document does not correspond to HTML 5.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, the attributes used for the [presentation of information](#presentation-of-information) must not be present in the generated source code of the pages. Is this rule respected?

1. Check that these presentation attributes are not present: `align`, `alink`, `background`, `bgcolor`, `border`, `cellpadding`, `cellspacing`, `char`, `charoff`, `clear`, `color`, `compact`, `frameborder`, `hspace`, `link`, `marginheight`, `marginwidth`, `text`, `valign`, `vlink`, `vspace`, `size` (with the exception of the `<select>` element), `width` (with the exception of the `<img>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<canvas>` and `<svg>` elements), `height` (with the exception of the `<img>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<canvas>` and `<svg>` elements).
2. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

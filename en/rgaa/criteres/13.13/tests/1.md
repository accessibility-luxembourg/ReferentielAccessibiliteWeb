1. Locate the document conversion functions on the page (export to PDF, .odt, HTML, etc.).
2. Identify accessibility information in the original content (alternative graphic elements, heading levels, table of contents, etc.).
3. Check that the accessibility information is still present in the converted document (unless the conversion format chosen does not support the accessibility information in the source document).
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

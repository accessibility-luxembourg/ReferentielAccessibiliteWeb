title: For each web page, does each [refresh process](#refresh-process) (`<object>` tag, `<embed>` tag, `<svg>` tag, `<canvas>` tag, `<meta>` tag) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The user can stop or restart the refresh.
  - The user can increase the time limit between two refreshes by at least ten times.
  - The user is warned that a refresh is imminent and has at least twenty seconds to increase the time limit before the next refresh.
  - The time limit between two refreshes is at least twenty hours.
---

1. Find in the document the refreshes initiated in the content by an `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` element or by a `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="[compteur]">` element (in the `<head>` element of the page).
2. For each refresh, check that
   - either there is a mechanism allowing the user to stop and restart the refresh;
   - or a mechanism is present which allows the user to increase the time limit between two refreshes by at least ten times;
   - or the presence of a mechanism which warns the user of the imminence of the refreshment, allows the user at least 20 seconds to increase the time limit before the next refreshment;
   - or the time limit between two refreshes is at least twenty hours.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: For each web page, does each [redirect](#redirect) carried out via a [script](#script) satisfy one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The user can stop or restart the redirect.
  - The user can increase the time limit before the redirect by at least ten times.
  - The user is warned that a redirect is imminent and has at least twenty seconds to increase the time limit before the next redirect.
  - The time limit before the redirect is at least twenty hours.

1. Find in the document the automatic redirects initiated by a script (in the form of a countdown for example).
2. For each automatic redirect, check that
   - Either there is a mechanism enabling the user to stop and restart the redirect.
   - Or the presence of a mechanism allows the user to increase the time limit before refreshment by at least ten times.
   - Or the presence of a mechanism, that warns the user of the imminence of the refreshment, gives the user at least 20 seconds to increase the time limit before the next refreshment.
   - Or the time limit before the redirect is at least twenty hours.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: For each web page, does each procedure limiting the time of a session meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The user can remove the time limit.
  - The user can increase the time limit.
  - The time limit before the end of the session is at least twenty hours.
---

1. Find in the document the procedures for limiting the time of a session (for example, after authentication).
2. For each process, check that
   - either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to remove the time limit;
   - or the presence of a mechanism allows the user to increase the time limit;
   - or the time limit is at least twenty hours.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, does every [text link](#text-link) indicated only by colour, and whose nature is not obvious, meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The colour of the link has a [contrast](#contrast) ratio greater than or equal to 3:1 in relation to the surrounding text.
  - The link has a visual hover indication other than a colour change.
  - The link has a visual indication on focus other than a colour change.

1. Find in the document link type elements (`<a>` element or element with a WAI-ARIA `role="link"` attribute).
2. For each link element, if it can be confused with normal text when indicated by colour alone, check that the contrast between the font colour of the link and the font colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1.
3. This check must be carried out for the different states of the link if they are presented using a different colour: the unvisited state, the visited state, the activated state, the hover state and the state when focused.
4. If this is the case for each element of the link type, **the test is validated**.

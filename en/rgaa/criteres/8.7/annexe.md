#### Special cases

There is special case management for language change for the following cases:

- Proper noun, the criterion is not applicable;
- Common name of a foreign language present in the official dictionary of the default language (see note 1 below) of the web page, the criterion is not applicable;
- The foreign language term submitted, via a [form input field](#form-input-field) and recalled in the page (for example as an indication of the term searched for in the case of a search engine), the criterion is not applicable;
- Passage of text whose language cannot be determined: the criterion does not apply;
- Term or passage of text from a dead or imaginary language for which there is no voice interpretation: the criterion is not applicable.

Note 1: the official dictionaries for languages frequently used on public sites in Luxembourg are as follows:

- for Luxembourgish: [Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire (LOD)](https://lod.lu/){lang="lb"} (the use of [spellchecker.lu](https://spellchecker.lu/) may help to detect words not found in the dictionary);
- for French: [Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé](http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlfi.htm){lang="fr"};
- for German: [Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache](https://www.dwds.de){lang="de"};
- for English: [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com).

Note 2: for common nouns in a foreign language that are not included in the official dictionary of the default language of the web page, and which have been passed on to the common language (e.g. newsletter): the criterion is only applicable when the absence of a language indication could lead to incomprehension when rendered by assistive technologies.

title: On each web page, does each text written in a language other than the [default language](#default-language) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The language indication is given on the element containing the text (`lang` and/or `xml:lang` attribute).
  - The language indication is given on one of the parent elements (`lang` and/or `xml:lang` attribute)

1. Find passages of text in a foreign language, with the exception of
   - proper names;
   - words of foreign origin, present in the dictionary of the language of the document;
   - words of foreign origin in common usage whose pronunciation does not cause misunderstanding.
2. Check that each passage of text selected has a language indication (`lang` and/or `xml:lang` attribute on the element itself or one of its parents).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

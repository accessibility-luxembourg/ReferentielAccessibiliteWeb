title: On each web page, does each [link](#link) have an [accessible name](#accessible-name-of-a-link) between `<a>` and `</a>`?

1. Find any links in the document.
2. For each link, check that the content of the `<a>` element (or of an element with a WAI-ARIA `role=link` attribute) contains an accessible name (text or alternative).
3. If this is the case for each link, **the test is validated**.

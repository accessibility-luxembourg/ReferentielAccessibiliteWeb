1. Find content in the document that flashes or causes flash effects using CSS animation.
2. For each piece of content that flashes or causes flash effects, check that
   - either the frequency of the effect is less than 3 per second;
   - or the total surface area is less than 21824 pixels.
3. If this is the case for each content item that flashes or causes flash effects, **the test is validated**.

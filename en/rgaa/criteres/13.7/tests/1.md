title: On each web page, does every image or multimedia element (`<video>` tag, `<img>` tag, `<svg>` tag, `<canvas>` tag, `<embed>` tag or `<object>` tag) that causes a sudden change in brightness or blinking meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The frequency of the effect is less than 3 per second.
  - The total cumulative area of the effects is less than or equal to 21824 pixels.

1. Find in the document content which flashes or causes flash effects of the animated image, video (see note) or animation type (`<img>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>`, `<embed>`, `<object>` or `<video>` elements).
2. For all content that flashes or causes flash effects, check that
   - either the frequency of the effect is less than 3 per second;
   - or the total surface area is less than 21824 pixels.
3. If this is the case for each content item that flashes or causes flash effects, **the test is validated**.

Note: assessing this criterion can be complex. When the effect is managed by a script or using CSS, analysis of the code is sufficient. The PEAT tool can be used to analyse videos in .avi format, for example. An example of a video that caused epileptic seizures can be found here: [London 2012 Olympics Seizure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs0hfhSje9M).

1. Find in the document form fields whose label is not visible or nearby (hidden, using the aria-label attribute) or is not attached to the field (using the `aria-labelledby` attribute).
2. For each form field, check that the form field
   - either has a `title` attribute, the content of which makes it possible to understand the nature of the expected input;
   - is accompanied by a passage of text next to the field which becomes visible when the focus is taken, so that the nature of the expected input can be understood;
   - is accompanied by a passage of visible text next to the field, enabling the nature of the expected input to be understood.

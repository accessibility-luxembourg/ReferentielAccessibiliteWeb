title: Does each [form input field](#form-input-field) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [form input field](#form-input-field) has a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute referencing an identified [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby).
  - The [form input field](#form-input-field) has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute.
  - A `<label>` tag with a `for` attribute is associated with the [form input field](#form-input-field).
  - The [form input field](#form-input-field) has a `title` attribute.
  - A button adjacent to the [form input field](#form-input-field) provides it with a visible label, and a visually hidden `<label>` element or a WAI-ARIA `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title` attribute provides it with an accessible name.

1. Find form fields in the document.
2. For each form field, check that the form field
   - has a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute referencing an identified passage of text;
   - has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
   - is associated with a `<label>` element having a `for` attribute;
   - has a `title` attribute;
   - a button adjacent to the form field provides it with a visible label and a visually hidden `<label>` element or a WAI-ARIA `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title` attribute provides it with an accessible name.
3. If this is the case for a form field, **the test is validated**.

title: For each [real-time-text-communication](#real-time-text-communication) web application, the transmission time for each [input unit](#input-unit) is 500ms or less. Is this rule respected?

1. Check that the web application allows real-time text (RTT) communication.
2. If it does, activate the web application and the written communication functionality on two separate terminals and connect them to the same session.
3. Enter text on the first terminal and observe its appearance on the second terminal. The appearance on the second terminal must be instantaneous (less than half a second). Depending on how the functionality is set up, each character is not sent individually. In fact, if the real-time text (RTT) communication functionality implements word prediction, it is when the desired word is selected that it is sent, and not when the first characters used to trigger the suggestion display are entered. A simple observation test may be sufficient to observe the instantaneous appearance on the terminal receiving the written message.
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

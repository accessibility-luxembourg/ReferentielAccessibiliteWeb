title: For each [data table](#data-table), does each [column header](#column-or-row-header) applying to the entire column satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [column header](#column-or-row-header) is implemented using a `<th>` tag.
  - The [column header](#column-or-row-header) is implemented using a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="columnheader"` attribute.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each column header that applies to the entire column, check that the column header is implemented using
   - either a `<th>` element;
   - or an element with a WAI-ARIA `role="columnheader"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each column header applying to the entire column, **the test is validated**.

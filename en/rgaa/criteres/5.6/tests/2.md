title: For each [data table](#data-table), does each [row header](#column-or-row-header) applying to the entire row satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [row header](#column-or-row-header) is implemented using a `<th>` tag.
  - The [row header](#column-or-row-header) is implemented using a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` attribute.

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each line header that applies to the whole line, check that the line header is implemented using
   - either a `<th>` element;
   - or an element with a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each line header applying to the entire line, **the test is validated**.

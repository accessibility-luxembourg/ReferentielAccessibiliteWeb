title: For each [data table](#data-table), is each header which does not apply to the entire row or column implemented using a `<th>` tag?
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header which does not apply to the entire row or column, check that the row header is implemented using a `<th>` element.
3. If this is the case for each header which does not apply to the whole row or column, **the test is validated**.

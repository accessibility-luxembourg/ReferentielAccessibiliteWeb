title: For each [data table](#data-table), is each cell associated with several headers implemented using a `<td>` or `<th>` tag?
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each cell associated with several headers, is it implemented using a `<th>` or `<td>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each header that does not apply to the whole row or column, **the test is validated**.

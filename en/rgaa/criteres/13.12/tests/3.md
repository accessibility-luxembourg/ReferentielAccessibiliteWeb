title: Can the user deactivate motion detection to avoid accidental activation of the feature (except in special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the features available by moving the device.
2. Check whether the user can disable motion detection.
3. If so, for each feature, check that it cannot be triggered.
4. If this is the case for each feature available by setting the device in motion, **the test is validated**.

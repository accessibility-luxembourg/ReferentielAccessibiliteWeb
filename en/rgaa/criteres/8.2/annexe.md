#### Note 

Assistive technologies no longer depend on direct analysis of HTML. Accessibility problems specifically linked to the validity of the code no longer exist. Errors reported by the validator which have an impact on people with disabilities are dealt with by other criteria.
From now on, the criterion must always be considered compliant.

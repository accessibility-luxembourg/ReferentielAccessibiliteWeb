title: For each [data table with a title](#data-table-with-a-title), is the title correctly associated with the data table?
---

1. Find the data tables with a title in the document.
2. For each title, check that it is provided by means of
   - either a `<caption>` element;
   - or a `title` attribute;
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute referencing a passage of text.
3. If this is the case for each data table title, **the test is validated**.

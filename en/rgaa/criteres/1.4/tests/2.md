title: For each image map area (`<area>` tag) used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha) or as a [test image](#test-image), having a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image), is this alternative relevant?
steps:
  - If present, the value of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) linked by the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<area>` elements with a text alternative and used as a CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each `<area>` element, check that the alternative text is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

title: For each [button](#button-form) of image type (`<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute) used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha) or as a [test image](#test-image), having a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image), is this alternative relevant?
steps:
  - If present, the value of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute and a text alternative, and used as a CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that the text alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

title: For each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised), does each feature meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The functionality can be [activated by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - A feature performing the same action is present on the page. This feature can be activated by keyboard or any pointing device.
---

1. Find the time-based media with control functions in the document.
2. For each time-based media, check that:
   - either the functionality can be activated using the keyboard and any pointing device;
   - or the page contains a function that can be activated using the keyboard and any pointing device to perform the same action.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

title: For each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised), does each feature meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The feature is [accessible by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - A feature [accessible by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) to perform the same action is present on the page.

1. Find the time-based media with control features in the document.
2. For each time-based media, check that
   - either the feature is accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device;
   - or a feature accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device enabling the same action to be performed is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

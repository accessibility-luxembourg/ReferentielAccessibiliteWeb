title: Does each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) have, if necessary, [viewing control](#viewing-control-time-based-media) features?

1. Find the time-based media in the document.
2. For each time-based media, check that the mandatory viewing control functions are present:
   - at least: play, pause or stop;
   - if the media has sound, it must have a sound on/off function;
   - if the media has subtitles or captions, it must have a function for controlling the appearance/disappearance of subtitles or captions;
   - if the media has audio description, it must have a function for controlling the appearance/disappearance of the audio description.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

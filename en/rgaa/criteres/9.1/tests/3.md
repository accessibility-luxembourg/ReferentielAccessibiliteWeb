title: On each web page, is each passage of text making up a [heading](#heading) implemented using a `<hx>` tag or a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="heading"` attribute associated with a WAI-ARIA `aria-level` attribute?
---

1. For each heading identified in test 9.1.1, check that
   - either it is implemented using a `<hx>` tag ("x" designating a numerical value between 1 and 6);
   - or it is implemented using a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="heading"` attribute and a WAI-ARIA `aria-level=x` attribute ("x" designating a numerical value).
2. If this is the case for each heading, **the test is validated**.

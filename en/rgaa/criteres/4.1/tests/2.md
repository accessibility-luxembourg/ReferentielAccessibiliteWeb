title: Does each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) meet, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative "audio only" version](#alternative-audio-only-version) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable [alternative audio only version](#alternative-audio-only-version) adjacent.
  - There is a [transcript](#transcript-time-based-media) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [transcript](#transcript-time-based-media).
  - There is a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).

1. Find in the document the time-based media (`<video>` or `<object>` elements) that require a transcript.
2. For each video-only time-based media, check for the presence of:
   - an alternative audio-only version accessible via an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor); or
   - an adjacent alternative audio-only version; or
   - a transcript accessible via an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor);
   - a clearly identifiable adjacent transcript; or
   - a synchronised audio description; or
   - an alternative version with an audio description accessible by means of an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor).
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

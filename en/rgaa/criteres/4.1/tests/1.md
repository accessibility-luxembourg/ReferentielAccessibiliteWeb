title: Does each pre-recorded audio-only [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) meet, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a [transcript](#transcript-time-based-media) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [transcript](#transcript-time-based-media).
---

1. Find in the document the time-based media (`<audio>`, `<video>` or `<object>` elements) that require a transcript.
2. For each audio-only time-based media item, check for the presence of a transcript:
   - either accessible via a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor);
   - or clearly identifiable adjacent.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

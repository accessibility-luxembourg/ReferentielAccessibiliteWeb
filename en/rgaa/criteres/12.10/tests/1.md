title: On each web page, does each [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut) using only one key (upper or lower case letter, punctuation, number or symbol) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - A mechanism is available to disable the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut).
  - A mechanism is available for configuring the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut) using the modifier keys (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, etc.).
  - In the case of a user [interface component](#user-interface-component), the associated [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut) can only be activated if the keyboard focus is on this component.

1. Find in the document all the keyboard shortcuts available to the user
2. For each keyboard shortcut, check that
   - either a mechanism is available to deactivate the keyboard shortcut;
   - or a mechanism is available for configuring the keyboard shortcut using the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc.);
   - or, in the case of a user interface component, the associated keyboard shortcut can only be activated if the keyboard focus is on this component.
3. If this is the case for each keyboard shortcut, **the test is validated**.

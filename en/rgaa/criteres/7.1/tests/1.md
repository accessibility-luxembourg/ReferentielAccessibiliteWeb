title: Does each [script](#script) that generates or controls a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) check, if necessary, one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [name, role, value, properties and changes of state](#name-role-value-properties-and-changes-of-state) are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API.
  - An accessible [user interface component](#user-interface-component) providing access to the same feature is present on the page.
  - An accessible [alternative](#alternative-to-a-script) provides access to the same functions.
---

1. Find all the user interface components generated or controlled using JavaScript in the document.
2. Check that
   - The component has a role consistent with its use (generally a button or a link).
   - The component has an explicit name.
   - The name of the component is consistent with the state of the feature or controlled content (for example, for a feature that displays or hides a content zone).
3. If not, check that there is an accessible user interface component providing access to the same feature.
4. If not, check for the presence of an accessible alternative providing access to the same feature.
5. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

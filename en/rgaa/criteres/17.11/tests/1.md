title: For each [two-way voice communication](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application) web application that has real-time video, are the following conditions met?
steps:
  - The video resolution is at least [QVGA](#qvga);
  - The frame rate is at least 20 frames per second;
  - The time lag between the video and the spoken words must not exceed 100 ms.
---

For the conditions concerning resolution and frame rate, the most reliable way of assessing this criterion is to search either the interface or the application documentation for this information. It is also recommended to ask the application publisher to provide these technical details.

For the last condition concerning the time lag between video and audio, the test can be established by simple observation:
1. Activate the web application on two devices.
2. Establish a video call connection between the two devices.
3. Check that speech and video are synchronised (lip-sync, lip movement).
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

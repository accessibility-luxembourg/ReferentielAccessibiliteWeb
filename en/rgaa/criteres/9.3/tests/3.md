title: On each web page, does the information grouped in the form of description [lists](#lists) use the tags `<dl>` and `<dt>/<dd>`?
---

1. Find the elements in the document that are visually grouped together in the form of a description list.
2. For each list, check that the list is implemented using the elements `<dl>`, `<dt>` and `<dd>`.
3. If this is the case for each description list, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, does the information visually grouped in the form of an unordered [list](#lists) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The list uses the HTML tags `<ul>` and `<li>`.
  - The list uses the WAI-ARIA attributes `role="list"` and `role="listitem"`.
---

1. Find elements in the document that are visually grouped together in the form of an unordered list.
2. For each list, check that the list is structured
   - either using the elements `<ul>` and `<li>`;
   - or using elements with WAI-ARIA attributes `role="list"` and `role="listitem"`.
3. If this is the case for each unordered list, **the test is validated**.

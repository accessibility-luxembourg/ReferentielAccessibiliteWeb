title: On each web page, does each automatically-triggered moving content meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The duration of the movement is less than or equal to 5 seconds.
  - The user can stop and restart the movement.
  - The user can show and hide the moving content.
  - The user can display all the information without the movement.

1. Find moving content in the document (obtained using an image, script or CSS effect) triggered automatically when the page is loaded or when content is displayed (see note).
2. For each content item, check that
   - either the duration of the movement is less than 5 seconds;
   - or there is a mechanism (a button, for example) to stop and restart the movement;
   - or either the presence of a mechanism (such as a button) means that the moving content can be hidden and displayed again;
   - or the presence of a mechanism (e.g. a button) enables the entire content to be displayed without movement.
3. If this is the case for each piece of moving content, **the test is validated**.

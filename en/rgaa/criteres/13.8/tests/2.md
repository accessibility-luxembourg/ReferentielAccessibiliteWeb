title: On each web page, does each automatically triggered blinking content meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The blinking duration is less than or equal to 5 seconds.
  - The user can stop and restart the blinking.
  - The user can show and hide the blinking content.
  - The user can display all the information without the blinking.
---

1. Find blinking content in the document (obtained using an image, a script or a CSS effect) triggered automatically when the page is loaded or when content is displayed (see note).
2. For each content item, check that
   - either the blinking time is less than 5 seconds;
   - there is a mechanism (a button, for example) to stop and restart the blinking;
   - or the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) means that the blinking content can be hidden and displayed again;
   - or a mechanism (such as a button) can be used to display all the blinking content.
3. If this is the case for each blinking content item, **the test is validated**.

Note: Stopping or pausing moving or blinking content by means of when focused (for example, the effect is only suspended when focused) is not considered a compliant process. In some cases, movement cannot be stopped, for example in the case of a progress bar, in which case the criterion is not applicable.

title: Do error messages providing an instruction or indication of data type and/or mandatory field indication meet any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The error message providing an instruction or indication of mandatory data type and/or format is visible and identifies the field concerned.
  - The field has the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
---

1. Find in the document error messages that provide an instruction or indication of data type and/or mandatory format for a field.
2. For each error message, check that
   - either the error message is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified;
   - or the field associated with the error message has an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each error message indicating that a mandatory field has not been entered, **the test is validated**.

title: Do fields with the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute that require a mandatory data type and/or format meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - An instruction or indication of data type and/or mandatory format is visible and located in the `<label>` tag associated with the field.
  - An instruction or indication of data type and/or mandatory format is visible and located in the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated with the field.
---

1. Find in the document the form fields which have an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that
   - either an instruction or indication of data type and/or mandatory format is visible and located in the `<label>` element associated with the field;
   - or an instruction or indication of data type and/or mandatory format is visible and located in the passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each form field which has an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute, **the test is validated**.

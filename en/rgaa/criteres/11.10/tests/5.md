1. Find in the document mandatory form fields with an associated instruction or indication of data type and/or format.
2. For each form field, check that the instruction or indication of mandatory data type and/or format is visible before the form is validated:
   - is visible and enables the field concerned to be identified;
   - visible in the label or passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each mandatory form field with an associated instruction or indication of data type and/or format, **the test is validated**.

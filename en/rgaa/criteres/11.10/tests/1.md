title: Do the [mandatory field indications](#mandatory-field-indication) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - A [mandatory field indication](#mandatory-field-indication) is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified before the form is validated.
  - The mandatory field has the `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute before the form is validated.
---

1. Find the mandatory form fields in the document.
2. For each form field, check that before validating the form
   - either a mandatory field indication is visible, identifying the field;
   - or the field has an `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each mandatory form field, **the test is validated**.

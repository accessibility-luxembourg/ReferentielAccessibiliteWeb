title: Do required fields with the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute meet any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The error message indicating that the input is invalid is visible and located in the label associated with the field.
  - The error message indicating that the input is invalid is visible and located in the [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated with the field.

1. Find in the document the mandatory form fields which have an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that
   - either the error message indicating that the input is invalid is visible and located in the label associated with the field;
   - or the error message indicating that the input is invalid is visible and located in the passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each mandatory form field which has an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute, **the test is validated**.

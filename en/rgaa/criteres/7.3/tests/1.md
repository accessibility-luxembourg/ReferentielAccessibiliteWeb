title: Does each element with an event handler controlled by a script meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The element is [accessible and operable by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - An element [accessible by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) allowing the same action to be performed is present on the page.

1. Find in the document all the elements on which a JavaScript event handler is implemented (for example click, focus, mouseover, blur, keydown, touch, etc.).
2. Check that the element can be accessed using the keyboard:
   - It can be reached with the tab key.
   - If the element manages a simple action, it can be activated from the keyboard using the enter key.
   - If the element handles a complex action, it can be accessed from the keyboard (generally using the arrow keys).
3. If not, check that the page contains an element that can be accessed from the keyboard to perform the same action.
4. Check that the element can be accessed using any pointing device (mouse, touch, stylus, etc.).
5. If not, check that the page contains an element that can be accessed using a pointing device and that performs the same action.
6. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

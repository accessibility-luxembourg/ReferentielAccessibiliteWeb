title: A [script](#script) must not remove the focus of an element which receives it. Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?

1. Activate, one after the other, all elements capable of receiving the focus.
2. Check that the focus is not removed via a JavaScript function.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, does each hidden content meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [hidden content](#hidden-content) is intended to be ignored by assistive technologies.
  - The [hidden content](#hidden-content) is not intended to be ignored by assistive technologies and is made renderable by assistive technologies following an action by the user using the keyboard or any pointing device on an element preceding the hidden content or following a repositioning of the focus on it.
---

1. Find hidden content (elements with the `hidden` attribute or the WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden` attribute, or a class or set of CSS styles likely to hide the content).
2. For each hidden content, check that
   - Either the hidden content is intended to be ignored by assistive technologies (a web analytics tracker for example).
   - Or the hidden content is not intended to be ignored by the assistive technologies, in which case it is made renderable by the assistive technologies by means of
     - Either an action performed by the user via the keyboard or any other pointing device on an element preceding the hidden content.
     - Or a programming function that repositions the focus on the content.
3. If this is the case for each hidden content item, **the test is validated**.

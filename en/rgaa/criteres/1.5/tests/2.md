title: Does each button associated with an image (`input` tag with the `type="image"` attribute) used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is another form of non-graphical [CAPTCHA](#captcha), at least.
  - There is another way to access the functionality secured by the [CAPTCHA](#captcha).
---

1. Find in the document the buttons associated with an image (`<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute) used as a CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each button associated with an image, check that there is
   - either another form of non-graphical CAPTCHA, at least;
   - or another solution for accessing the functionality that is secured by the CAPTCHA.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

title: Does each image (`<img>`, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` tags or tags with a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is another form of non-graphical [CAPTCHA](#captcha), at least.
  - There is another way to access functionality that is secured by the [CAPTCHA](#captcha).
---

1. Find in the document the images (`<img>`, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` elements or elements with a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) used as CAPTCHA or test image.
2. For each image, check that there is
   - either another form of non-graphical CAPTCHA, at least;
   - or another solution for accessing the functionality that is secured by the CAPTCHA.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.

1. Find in the document form fields that are `<input>` of type `checkbox` or `radio` or elements with a WAI-ARIA `role="checkbox"`, `role="radio"` or `role="switch"` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that the label is visually attached:
   - Immediately below or to the right of the form field when the reading direction of the label language is from left to right.
   - Immediately below or to the left of the form field when the label's language reading direction is from right to left.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.

1. Find in the document form fields which are not `<input>` elements of type `checkbox` or `radio` or elements with a WAI-ARIA `role="checkbox"`, `role="radio"` or `role="switch"` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that the label is visually attached:
   - Immediately above or to the left of the form field when the reading direction for the label language is left to right.
   - Immediately above or to the right of the form field when the label's language reading direction is from right to left.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.

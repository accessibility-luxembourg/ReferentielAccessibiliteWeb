title: On each web page, does the text remain legible when the display is modified according to these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The spacing between lines (`line-height`) is increased up to 1.5 times the font size.
  - The spacing between paragraphs (`<p>` tag) is increased to 2 times the font size.
  - Letter spacing (`letter-spacing`) is increased to 0.12 times the font size.
  - Word-spacing is increased to 0.16 times the font size.
---

1. Modify the document styles by giving
   - a value of 1.5 to the `line-height` property of all document elements;
   - a value of 2em to the `margin-bottom` property of the `<p>` elements;
   - a value of 0.12em for the `letter-spacing` property of all the elements in the document;
   - a value of 0.16em for the `word-spacing` property of all the elements in the document.
2. For each passage of text, check that it remains legible, with the exception of
   - subtitles or captions directly integrated into a video;
   - images of text;
   - text within a `<canvas>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each passage of text, **the test is validated**.

Note: an implementation of these modification rules is available in the WCAG 1.4.12 success criteria resources (https://github.com/alastc/adaptation-scripts/blob/master/scripts/text-adaptation.js).

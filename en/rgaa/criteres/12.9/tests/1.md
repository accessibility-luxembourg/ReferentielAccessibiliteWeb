title: On each web page, does each [element receiving focus](#when-focused) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - It is possible to reach the next or previous element that can receive the focus with the tab key.
  - The user is informed of a functional mechanism enabling the next or previous element to be reached using the keyboard.
---

1. Find all the interface elements in the document that can receive focus (using the tab key or a script).
2. For each interface element, check that the user can move to the next or previous element that can receive focus
   - either using the tab key (<kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>);
   - or by means of another keyboard interaction of which the user is aware (for example, the arrow keys).
3. If this is the case for each interface element, **the test is validated**.

Note: some complex interface elements, such as a group of radio buttons, a listbox and all the components developed with WAI-ARIA call for optimised navigations which generally use the arrow keys to move from one part of the component to another. For example, in a group of radio buttons, the options can be navigated using the arrow keys. Similarly, in a tabbed system, the user activates the tabs using the arrow keys. The test on the keyboard trap is then limited to checking that the component is reached with the tab key and that it is possible to move on to the next component or return to the previous component.

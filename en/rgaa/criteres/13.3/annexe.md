#### Special cases

Special cases can be managed:

- If the office files (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Office or LibreOffice documents, etc.) were published before 23 September 2018 (unless this content is necessary for the needs of active administrative processes concerning tasks carried out by the public sector body concerned), they are exempt from the accessibility obligation, according to the law of [28 May 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo)

In this situation, the criterion is not applicable.

In the case of PDF documents, if there is no accessible alternative version, they must comply with the [PDF accessibility assessment framework (RAPDF)](../rapdf1/index.html).

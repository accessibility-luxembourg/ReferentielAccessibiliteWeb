1. Find the information (provided by colour) in a text in the document.
2. For each of these items of information, check that there is another way of retrieving the information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect in terms of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.

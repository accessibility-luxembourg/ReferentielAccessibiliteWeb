1. Find in the document the information provided by the colour in a word or set of words.
2. For each of these pieces of information, check that there is another way of retrieving this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect in terms of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.

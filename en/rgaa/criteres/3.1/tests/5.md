title: For each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information-provided-by-colour), the [information](#information-provided-by-colour) must not be provided by colour alone. Is this rule respected?

1. Find the information provided by the colour in the document in a time-based medium.
2. For each of these pieces of information, check that there is another way of retrieving this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, is the additional content that appears when hovering, focusing or activating a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) accessible by keyboard if necessary?

1. Find in the document all the additional content that appears when hovering, focusing or activating a user interface component.
2. For each additional content item, if it contains user interface components that the user can interact with using the keyboard (for example, a customised tooltip with a link in its content), check that these user interface components can be reached using the keyboard.
3. If this is the case for each additional content item, **the test is validated**.

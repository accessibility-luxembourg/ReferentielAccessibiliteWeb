title: For each tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` or `role="columnheader"` attribute whose content applies to the entire row or column, does the tag meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The tag has a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` attribute for [row headers](#column-or-row-header).
  - The tag has a WAI-ARIA `role="columnheader"` attribute for [column headers](#column-or-row-header).

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header that applies to the entire row or column and has a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` or `"columnheader"` attribute, check that the element has
   - either a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` attribute for row headers;
   - or a WAI-ARIA `role="columnheader"` attribute for column headers.
3. If this is the case for each header that applies to the entire row or column and has a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` or `"columnheader"` attribute, **the test is validated**.

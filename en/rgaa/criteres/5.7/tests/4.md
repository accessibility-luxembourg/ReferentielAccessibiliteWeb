title: For each `<td>` or `<th>` tag content associated with one or more headers with an `id` attribute, does the tag check these conditions?
steps:
  - The tag has a `headers` attribute.
  - The `headers` attribute has a list of `id` attribute values for the associated [headers](#column-or-row-header).
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each `<td>` or `<th>` element associated with one or more headers with an `id` attribute, check that
   - the `<td>` or `<th>` element has a `headers` attribute;
   - the `headers` attribute has the list of `id` attribute values for the associated headers.
3. If this is the case for each `<td>` or `<th>` element associated with one or more headers with an `id` attribute, **the test is validated**.

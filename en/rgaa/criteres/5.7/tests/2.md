title: For each `<th>` tag content that applies to the whole row or column and has a `scope` attribute, does the `<th>` tag meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute with the `"row"` value for [row headers](#column-or-row-header).
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute with the `"col"` value for [column headers](#column-or-row-header).
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (`<th>` element) applying to the whole row or column and provided with a `scope` attribute, check that the `scope` attribute has
   - either a `"row"` value for row headers;
   - or a `"col"` value for column headers.
3. If this is the case for each header which applies to the entire row or column and has an `scope` attribute, **the test is validated**.

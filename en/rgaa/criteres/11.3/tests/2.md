title: Is every [label](#form-field-label) associated with a [form field](#form-input-field) having the same function and repeated in a set of web pages [consistent](#consistent-labels)?
---

1. Find the form input fields with the same function in the set of web pages under consideration (for example the search engine input field or the newsletter registration input field).
2. For each form input field, check that the labels are consistent (they make it clear that the inputs are identical).
3. If this is the case for each form field on all the pages in question, **the test is validated**.

title: Is each [label](#form-field-label) associated with a [form field](#form-field-label) having the same function and repeated several times in the same page [consistent](#consistent-labels)?
---

1. Find in the document the form fields with the same function (for example, several address fields).
2. For each form input field, check that the labels are consistent (they make it clear that the inputs are identical).
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.

	- if it is an office document in PDF format, that it complies with the [PDF accessibility assessment framework (RAPDF)](../rapdf1/index.html);
	- in the case of a non-web document that is not in PDF format, that it complies with the criteria of [section 10 Non-web documents](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf#page=52) of European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1.

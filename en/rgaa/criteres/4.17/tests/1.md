title: For each pre-recorded [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised), does the presentation of the captions respect one of these conditions?
steps:
- The user-defined caption presentation system settings apply to the captions.
- There is a feature on the page that allows the user to change the caption presentation settings.
---

1. Locate pre-recorded time-based media with captions.
2. Define one or more caption presentation parameters from the customisation options provided by the operating system, for example: caption size, colour, border style, background colour, background opacity, etc. (Note: the standard does not give a precise list of parameters that must be defined, so the ability to modify a single caption characteristic is sufficient to make the criterion compliant).
3. Check that the defined parameters are applied to the captions.
4. If not, check the page to see if there is a function that allows you to change the presentation parameters of the captions (on the page or directly from the media player). 
5. Check that the defined parameters are applied to the captions.
6. If this is the case, the test is validated.

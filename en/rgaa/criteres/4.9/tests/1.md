title: For each [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media) with an alternative, does this alternative provide access to the same content and similar features?
---

1. Find in the document the non-time-based media associated with an alternative.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that the alternative is relevant (it provides access to the same content and similar functions).
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.

title: Is each [clickable area](#clickable-area) in a server-side image map accompanied by a mechanism that can be used regardless of the pointing device used and allows to access the same destination?

1. Find in the document the `<img>` elements with the `ismap` attribute.
2. For each `<img>` element with the `ismap` attribute, check for the presence of a link or set of links (or another type of user interface component which plays a similar role, such as a combobox, for example) providing access to the same resources as when the image is clicked.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

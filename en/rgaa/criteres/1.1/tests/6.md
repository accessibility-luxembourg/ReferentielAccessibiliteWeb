title: Does each [object image](#object-image) (`<object>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<object>` tag has a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) and a `role="img"` attribute;
  - The `<object>` element is immediately followed by an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to [alternative content](#alternative-content);
  - A mechanism allows the user to replace the `<object>` element with [alternative content](#alternative-content).
---

1. Find in the document the opening `<object>` tags with the `type="image/..."` attribute.
2. For each opening `<object>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute, determine whether the image used is conveying information.
3. Check that the `<object>` element has a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
4. Check that the `<object>` element has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - passage of text associated via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
   - value of the `title` attribute.
5. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
6. Otherwise, check that:
   - either the `<object>` element is immediately followed by an adjacent link or button providing access to alternative content;
   - or a mechanism allows the user to replace the `<object>` element with alternative content.
7. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

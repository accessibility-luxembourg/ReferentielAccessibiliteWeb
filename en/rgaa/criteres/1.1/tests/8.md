title: Does each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<canvas>` tag has a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) and a `role="img"` attribute;
  - An [alternative content](#alternative-content) is present between the `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags;
  - The `<canvas>` element is immediately followed by an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to [alternative content](#alternative-content);
  - A mechanism allows the user to replace the `<canvas>` element with [alternative content](#alternative-content).

1. Find `<canvas>` elements in the document.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, determine whether the image used conveys information.
3. Check that the `<canvas>` element has a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
4. Check that the opening `<canvas>` tag has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - passage of text associated via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute.
5. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
6. If steps 3 and 4 are not satisfied, check that:
   - either the `<canvas>` element has alternative content between the `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags;
   - or the `<canvas>` element is immediately followed by an adjacent link or button providing access to alternative content;
   - or a mechanism allows the user to replace the `<canvas>` element with alternative content.
7. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

Note: if the `<canvas>` element has an `img` role, its alternative can only be provided by the techniques listed in step 4.

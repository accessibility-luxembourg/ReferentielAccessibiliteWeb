title: Does each button of type `image` (`<input>` tag with `type="image"` attribute) have a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image)?
---

1. Find in the document the `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute.
2. For each `<input>` element with the attribute type="image", determine whether the image used conveys information.
3. Check that the `<input>` element has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - passage of text associated via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
   - value of the `alt` attribute;
   - value of the `title` attribute.
4. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.

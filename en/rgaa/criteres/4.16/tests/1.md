title: For each feature that transmits, converts or records pre-recorded time-based media with audio description, at the end of the process does the audio description meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The audio description is present.
  - The audio description can be activated.
  - The audio description is correctly synchronised.
---

1. Identify the features for transmitting, converting or recording time-based media. For example: send content to another terminal or by email, convert an .avi format video into an .mpg format, record a video from a broadcasting platform on your personal computer.
2. Perform each of the features (send, convert and record).
3. For each feature, check whether audio description
   - is present
   - can be activated;
   - is correctly synchronised:
      - the sounds and words of the audio description do not overlap with those of the original soundtrack and do not cause perception and comprehension problems;
      - the information conveyed in the audio description is given at the same time as the equivalent visual information appears.
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

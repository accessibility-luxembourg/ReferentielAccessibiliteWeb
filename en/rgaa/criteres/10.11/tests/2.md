title: For each web page, when content with a vertical reading direction is displayed in a window reduced to a height of 256 px, is all the information and functions available without any vertical scrolling (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find the information and functions in the document if its content is designed to scroll horizontally (the text reading direction is vertical).
2. Reduce the display window to a height of 256 px and check that the information and functions remain available without any vertical scrolling.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

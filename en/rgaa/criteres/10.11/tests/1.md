title: For each web page, when the content with a horizontal reading direction is displayed in a window reduced to a width of 320 px, is all the information and functions available without any horizontal scrolling (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find the information and functions in the document if its content is designed to scroll vertically (the text reading direction is horizontal).
2. Reduce the display window to a width of 320 px and check that the information and functions remain available without any horizontal scrolling.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

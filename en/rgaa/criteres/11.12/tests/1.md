title: For each form that modifies or deletes data, or transmits answers to a test or exam, or whose validation has financial or legal consequences, does the data capture meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The user can [modify or cancel data and carried out actions](#modify-or-cancel-data-and-carried-out-actions) on this data after the form has been validated.
  - The user can check and correct data before validating a form in several stages.
  - An explicit confirmation mechanism, via a checkbox (`<input>` tag of the `checkbox` type or tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="checkbox"` attribute) or an additional step, is present.
---

1. Find in the document forms which modify or delete data, or which transmit answers to a test or examination, or whose validation has financial or legal consequences.
2. For each form, check that the user can
   - either modify or cancel data and carried out actions on this data after validation of the form;
   - or check and correct the data before validating a form in several stages; or
   - or have an explicit confirmation mechanism (for example, a checkbox or an additional step).
3. If this is the case for each form found, **the test is validated**.

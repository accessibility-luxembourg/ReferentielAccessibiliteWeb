title: Does each form whose validation modifies or deletes financial, legal or personal data meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a mechanism for recovering data deleted or modified by the user.
  - A mechanism for requesting explicit confirmation of the deletion or modification, via a [form input field](#form-input-field) or an additional step, is proposed.
---

1. Find in the document the forms that modify or delete financial, legal or personal data.
2. For each form, check that the user has
   - either a mechanism for recovering deleted or modified data;
   - or a mechanism for requesting explicit confirmation of the deletion or modification (for example, a tick box or an additional step).
3. If this is the case for each form recovered, **the test is validated**.

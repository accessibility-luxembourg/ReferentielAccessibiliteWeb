title: Does each web application that enables [two-way voice communication](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
- The web application has built-in [real-time text communication](#real-time-text-communication) functionality;
- The web application can be connected to a terminal with integrated [real-time text communication](#real-time-text-communication) functionality.

1. Check that the web application allows two-way voice communication.
2. If this is the case, check that a real-time text (RTT) function is available (it may sometimes be necessary to activate a dedicated parameter in the application to enable real-time text (RTT)).
3. If not, check whether the web application can connect to a terminal with real-time text (RTT) functionality. This assessment can be complex to carry out without the availability of a real-time communication terminal or if the network used by the terminal does not support real-time text protocols. A first step may be to search the documentation or ask the application editor directly.
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

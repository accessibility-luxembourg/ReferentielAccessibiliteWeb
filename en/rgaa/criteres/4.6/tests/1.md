title: For each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) with a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media), is the audio description relevant?
---

1. Find in the document the video-only time-based media that have an audio description.
2. For each time-based media, check that the synchronised audio description is relevant (all the visual information that can be vocalised in the blanks of the main soundtrack is present, in particular the inlaid texts).
3. If this is the case for each video-only time-based media, **the test is validated**.

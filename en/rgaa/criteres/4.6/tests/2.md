title: For each synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) with a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media), is it relevant?

1. Find in the document the synchronised time-based media with an audio description.
2. For each time-based media, check that the audio description is relevant (all the visual information that can be vocalised in the blanks of the main soundtrack is present, including inlaid text).
3. If this is the case for each synchronised time-based media, **the test is validated**.

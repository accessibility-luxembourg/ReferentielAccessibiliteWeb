title: For each [real-time text (RTT)](#real-time-text-communication) functionality, do the messages respect these conditions?
steps:
- Received and sent messages are separated in the presentation;
- The presentation identifies the nature of the message (received or sent);
- The nature of the message (received or sent) is accessible to assistive technologies.
---

1. Activate the web application and the application's real-time text (RTT) functionality on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
2. Send a text message from both terminals to obtain messages with different statuses (sent and received).
3. Check that 
	- sent and received messages are visually separated (for example, sent messages are in one window and received messages in another, or there is a line break between each received and sent message if they are presented in the same window);
	- it is visually possible to distinguish between messages sent and messages received. For example, by a layout or colour that differentiates them or by a visible text annotation (look for the words "Sent" near a message that has been sent or "Received" near a message that has been received);
	- information about the nature of the message (received or sent) is accessible to assistive technologies (text information is available to provide this information).
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

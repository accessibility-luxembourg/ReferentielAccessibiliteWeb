title: For each [real-time text communication](#real-time-text-communication) functionality used with a [two-way voice communication](#two-way-voice-communication-web-application) functionality that identifies the speakers, do the messages respect these conditions?
steps:
- The presentation enables the authors of the messages to be identified;
- The identification of the author of the message is accessible to assistive technologies.

1. Activate the web application and the application's real-time text (RTT) functionality on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
2. Send a written message from both terminals to get messages from different authors.
3. Check that the authors of the text messages are identified (for example, the presence of a name or identifier preceding the message).
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

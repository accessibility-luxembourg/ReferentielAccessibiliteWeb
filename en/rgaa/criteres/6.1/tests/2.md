title: Does each [image link](#image-link) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [accessible name of a link](#accessible-name-of-a-link) alone makes it possible to understand its function and destination.
  - The [accessible name of a link](#accessible-name-of-a-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) enables us to understand the function and destination of the link.
---

1. Find the image links in the document (link with the content of an `<img>` element or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute, an `<area>` element with a `href` attribute, an `<object>` element, a `<canvas>` element or a `<svg>` element).
2. For each image link, check that the information used to understand its function and destination is
   - either the accessible name of the link alone, provided by the text alternative (image);
   - or the link context.
3. If this is the case for each image link, **the test is validated**.

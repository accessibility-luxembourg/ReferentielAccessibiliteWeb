title: For each [link](#link) with a [visible label](#visible-label), does the [accessible name of the link](#accessible-name-of-a-link) contain at least the [visible label](#visible-label) (excluding special cases)?

1. Find in the document links other than SVG whose content is provided both by a visible label and by the content of either a title attribute, an `aria-label` attribute or an `aria-labelledby` attribute.
2. For each link, check that the value of the `title` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute or the `aria-labelledby` attribute contains the visible label.
3. If this is the case for each link, **the test is validated** for links other than SVG.
4. Find in the document the SVG links whose content is provided both by a visible label and by the content of either an `aria-labelledby` attribute, or an `aria-label` attribute or a title element (direct child of the `<svg>` element) or an x-link:title attribute (SVG 1.1) or one or more `<text>` elements.
5. For each SVG link, check that the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute or the `<title>` element or the `x-link:title` attribute or one or more `<text>` elements contains the visible label.
6. If this is the case for each SVG link, **the test is validated** for the SVG links.
7. If the test is validated for both non-SVG links and SVG links, the test is validated overall.

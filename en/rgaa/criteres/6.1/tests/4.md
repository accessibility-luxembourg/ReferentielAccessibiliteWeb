title: Does every [SVG link](#svg-link) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [accessible name of a link](#accessible-name-of-a-link) alone makes it possible to understand its function and destination.
  - The [accessible name of a link](#accessible-name-of-a-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) enables us to understand its function and destination.
---

1. Find SVG links in the document (`<svg>` element which has an `<a>` element with a `xlink-href` attribute (SVG 1.1) or `href` (SVG 2)).
2. For each SVG link, check that what makes it possible to understand the function and destination of the link is
   - either the accessible name of the link alone, provided by the accessible name of the `<svg>` element (generally resolved from the content of a `<text>` element);
   - or the link context.
3. If this is the case for each SVG link, **the test is validated**.

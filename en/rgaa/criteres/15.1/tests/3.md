title: Does each [editing tool](#editing-tool) that creates content in non-web format (except PDF) allow the definition of the [accessibility information](#accessibility-information) necessary to create content that complies with the criteria of [section 10 Non-web documents](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf#page=52) of the European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1?

1. Identify the editing features in the tool (for example, a text editor, but it could also be a media library or any other interface making it possible to enter text or define properties) that allow you to create content in non-web format (other than PDF).
2. Check that it is possible to define the accessibility information required to make the content compliant with the criteria of [section 10 Non-web documents](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf#page=52) of European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1. For example 
	- defining the text alternative for an image from the text editor or a media library;
	- defining the accessible name of a link;
	- etc.
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.

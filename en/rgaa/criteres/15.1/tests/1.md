title: Does each [editing tool](#editing-tool) that creates content in web format (HTML, CSS) allow you to define the [accessibility information](#accessibility-information) needed to create content that complies with the [RAWeb](../raweb1/index.html)?
---
1. Identify the editing functions in the tool (for example, a text editor, but it could also be a media library or any other interface making it possible to enter text or define properties) that allow you to create content in web format (HTML, CSS).
2. Check that it is possible to define the accessibility information needed to make the content compliant with [RAWeb](../raweb1/index.html). For example 
	- defining the text alternative for an image from the text editor or a media library;
	- defining the accessible name of a link;
	- etc.
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.

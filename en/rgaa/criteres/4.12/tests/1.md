title: For each [non-time-based media](#non-time-based-media), does each feature meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The feature is [accessible by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - A feature [accessible by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) enabling the same action to be performed is present on the page.

1. Find the non-time-based media with control features in the document.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that
   - either the feature is accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device;
   - or a function accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device enabling the same action to be performed is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.

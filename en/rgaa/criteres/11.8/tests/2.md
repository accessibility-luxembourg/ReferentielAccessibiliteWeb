title: In each `<select>` tag, does each `<optgroup>` tag have a `label` attribute?
---

1. In the document, find the combobox (`<select>` element) which have elements `<optgroup>`.
2. For each `<optgroup>` element, check that it has a `label` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each `<optgroup>` element, **the test is validated**.

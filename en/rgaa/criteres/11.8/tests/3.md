title: For each `<optgroup>` tag with a `label` attribute, is the value of the `label` attribute relevant?

1. In the document, find the comboboxes (`<select>` element) which have elements `<optgroup>` with a `label` attribute.
2. For each `label` attribute, check that its content is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each `label` attribute, **the test is validated**.

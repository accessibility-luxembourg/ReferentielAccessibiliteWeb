title: Does each pre-recorded synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [transcript](#transcript-time-based-media) is relevant.
  - The synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) is relevant.
  - The synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) of the alternative version is relevant.
---

1. Find the synchronised pre-recorded time-based media in the document.
2. For each synchronised time-based media, check the relevance of:
   - the transcript; or
   - the synchronised audio description; or
   - the synchronised audio description of the alternative version.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.

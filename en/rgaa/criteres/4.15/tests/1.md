title: For each feature that transmits, converts or records [pre-recorded synchronised time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) that has a [captions](#synchronised-captions-media-object) track, do the captions meet at the end of the process these conditions?
steps:
  - Captions are present.
  - Captions can be displayed.
  - Captions are correctly synchronised.
  - The [key features of captions](#key-features-of-captions) are preserved.

1. Identify the features that allow you to transmit (e.g. send content to another terminal or send a video by e-mail), convert (e.g. convert a video in .avi format to .mpg format) or record pre-recorded synchronised time-based media (e.g. record a video from a broadcasting platform onto your personal computer). 
2. Perform each of the functions (transmit, convert and record).
3. For each function, check that the captions
   - are always present;
   - can be displayed;
   - are correctly synchronised;
   - retain their key features (for example, if the captions were coloured according to the speaker, the colours must be retained).
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.

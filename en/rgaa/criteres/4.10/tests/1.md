title: Does each sound sequence automatically triggered via an `<object>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<embed>`, `<bgsound>` tag or a JavaScript code meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The sound sequence lasts 3 seconds or less.
  - The sound sequence can be stopped by the user.
  - The volume of the sound sequence can be controlled by the user independently of the system volume control.

1. When the document is loaded, if a sound is triggered automatically, check that
   - either the sound sequence lasts 3 seconds or less;
   - or a device (a button, for example) on the element that triggered the sound (see note), or on the page, can be used to stop it;
   - or the volume of the sequence can be controlled by the user, independently of the system volume control.
2. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

Note: the following elements are likely to trigger sounds when the page is loaded: `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<bgsound>` elements or JavaScript code (using the Web Audio API, for example).

title: On each web page, for each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised), information must not be conveyed solely [by shape, size or location](#indication-conveyed-by-shape-size-or-location). Is this rule implemented appropriately?
---

1. Find in the document the information for a time-based media given by its shape, size or position.
2. For each item of information given by shape, size or position, check that the alternative means of retrieving this information is relevant, i.e. that it allows the information to be transmitted in all viewing contexts and for all users.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.

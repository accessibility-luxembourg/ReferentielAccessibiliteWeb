title: In the [mechanism for displaying a compliant contrast ratio](#mechanism-for-displaying-a-compliant-contrast-ratio), are the colours of the component or of its graphic element conveying information sufficiently contrasted?
---

1. Find in the document the mechanisms that enable a compliant contrast ratio to be displayed.
2. For each of these mechanisms, check that the contrast ratio between the colours of the component or the graphic element conveying information of which it is composed is sufficiently high.
3. If this is the case for each mechanism, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, does the [contrast](#contrast) ratio between the different [adjacent colours](#adjacent-background-colour-and-adjacent-colour) of a [graphic element](#graphic-element), when they are necessary for its understanding, meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [contrast](#contrast) ratio is at least 3:1.
  - A [mechanism](#mechanism-for-displaying-a-compliant-contrast-ratio) allows a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of at least 3:1.

1. Find in the document the graphic elements that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these elements, check that
   - either the contrast ratio between the different adjacent colours of the graphic element, when they are necessary for its understanding, is at least 3:1;
   - a mechanism allows the user to display the graphic element with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
3. If this is the case for each graphic element, **the test is validated**.

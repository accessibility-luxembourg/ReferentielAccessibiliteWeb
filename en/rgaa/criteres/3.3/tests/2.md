title: On each web page, does the [contrast](#contrast) ratio between the different colours making up a [graphic element](#graphic-element), when they are necessary for its understanding, and the [adjacent background colour](#adjacent-background-colour-and-adjacent-colour), meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [contrast](#contrast) ratio is at least 3:1.
  - A [mechanism](#mechanism-for-displaying-a-compliant-contrast-ratio) allows a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of 3:1, at least.

1. Find in the document the graphic elements that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these elements, check that
   - either the contrast ratio between the colours of the graphic element required to understand it and the adjacent background colour is at least 3:1;
   - or a mechanism allows the user to display the graphic element with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
3. If this is the case for each component, **the test is validated**.

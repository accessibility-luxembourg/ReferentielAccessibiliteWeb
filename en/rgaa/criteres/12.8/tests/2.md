title: For each [script](#script) that updates or inserts content, does the [navigation sequence](#navigation-sequence) remain [consistent](#understandable-reading-order)?
---

1. Find all the content inserted in the document using a script (display hidden elements, update content using AJAX for example).
2. Position the tab on the trigger element and activate it.
3. After displaying the updated content, check that the navigation sequence remains consistent (correct repositioning of the focus).
4. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

title: On each web page, is the [navigation sequence](#navigation-sequence) in the content [consistent](#understandable-reading-order)?
---

1. Tab forward (Tab key) and backward (Shift+Tab key) through all the content in the document.
2. Check that the order in which the focus is moved is consistent with the content in question (for example, the navigation sequence in a modal window should only consider the interface elements present in this window).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.

Note: the navigation sequence does not have to follow the natural reading order (left to right and top to bottom, for example) as long as the elements are accessible in a coherent order.

title: Is each [legend](#legend) associated with a group of [related form controls](#related-form-controls) relevant?
---

1. Find groups of related form controls in the document.
2. For each group of related form controls in the form, or for each related form control that has a legend, check that the text in the legend is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each group of form fields or for each of the related form controls, **the test is validated**.

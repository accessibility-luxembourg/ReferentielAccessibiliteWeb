title: On each web page, does the [document structure](#document-structure) meet these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [page header region](#header-region) is structured using a `<header>` tag.
  - The [main and secondary navigation regions](#menu-and-navigation-bar) are implemented using a `<nav>` tag.
  - The `<nav>` tag is reserved for structuring the [main and secondary navigation regions](#menu-and-navigation-bar).
  - The [main content region](#main-content-region) is structured using a `<main>` tag.
  - The [document structure](#document-structure) uses a single visible `<main>` tag.
  - The [footer region](#footer-region) is structured using a `<footer>` tag.

1. Check that the header region is structured using a `<header>` element.
2. Check that the main and secondary navigation areas are implemented using a `<nav>` element.
3. Check that the `<nav>` element is not used outside the structuring of the main and secondary navigation zones.
4. Check that the main content region is structured using a `<main>` element.
5. If the document has several `<main>` elements, check that only one of these elements is visible (the other occurrences of the element have a `hidden` attribute).
6. Check that the footer region is structured using a `<footer>` element.
7. If this is the case for each content zone, **the test is validated**.

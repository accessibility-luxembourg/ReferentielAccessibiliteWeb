title: Control (moving or blinking content)
---

The ability for the user to control the display or playback of moving or blinking content using at least the keyboard and mouse.

All moving content, with the exception of time-based media supported by the multimedia theme, is covered: animated images (e.g. an animated gif), moving content offered via an `<object>` tag, JavaScript code or CSS effects, for example.

Note 1: where appropriate, the control method should be available as the first element of the page.

Note 2: The control (moving or blinking content) method must allow the user to interact with the rest of the page. Consequently, stopping or pausing via an event triggered only when focused does not validate the criterion.

Note 3: In some cases, movement is an integral part of the component and it is not possible to give the user control of it, for example a progress bar whose function is to indicate the progress of an event such as a download by movement. In this case the criterion is Not Applicable.

title: Ambiguous to users in general

Intent cannot be determined from the link and all the information on the web page presented to the user at the same time as the link (i.e. a reader with no functional limitations would not know the function of a link before activating it). Example: the word "guava" in the following sentence used as a link: "One of the important exports is guava". This link could lead to a definition of guava, a graph showing a list of the quantities of guavas exported or a photo of people harvesting guavas. Until the link is activated, all users are in the dark, so a person with disabilities is not at a disadvantage.

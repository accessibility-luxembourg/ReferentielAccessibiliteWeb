Set of all web pages

- Connected by web links;
- Belonging to the same domain name (e.g. design.numerique.gouv.fr);
- Which form a coherent whole from the user's point of view.

Special case of web pages in a sub-domain; a sub-domain can

- Either belong to the website attached to the domain name, if the user perceives them to be consistent with the other pages of the website (for example: same structure, same navigation, etc.);
- Or not belong to the website attached to the domain name (for example: different blogs in the sub-domain of a domain name and unrelated to each other).

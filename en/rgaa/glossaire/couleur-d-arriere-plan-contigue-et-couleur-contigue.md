title: Adjacent background colour and adjacent colour
---

Adjacent background colour: background colour directly in contact with the outer edge of the user interface component or [graphic element](#graphic-element).

Examples:

- For a white button with a blue border on a white background, the white background outside the blue border corresponds to the adjacent background colour;
- For a red button on a white background, the white background outside the red border corresponds to the adjacent background colour;
- For a white button with a green border which becomes black when focused and hovered, the white background outside the green border of the default state and the black border of the state when focused and hovered corresponds to the adjacent background colour.

Adjacent colour: colour directly in contact with another colour.
For example, in a "no entry" sign, the red of the sign is the colour adjacent to the white line in the centre of the sign.

Note 1: in the case of a gradient, the adjacent colour with the least contrast in the gradient is considered to be the adjacent colour or adjacent background colour.

Note 2: if several colours are present, all the colours will be considered as the adjacent colour or adjacent background colour.

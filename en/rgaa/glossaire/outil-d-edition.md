title: Editing tool
---

A web application or editing component in a web page that allows content to be created or modified for distribution to other users. An editing tool can be used by one or more users working collaboratively.

An editing tool can be

- the tool as delivered by the publisher;
- the tool augmented with extensions not developed by the publisher;
- a set of tools.

Examples of editing tools

- application for editing and controlling the content of websites or applications, e.g. CMS (Content Management System), LMS (Learning Management System), LCMS (Learning Content Management System), content aggregator;
- applications for creating office documents (e.g. for distribution in PDF format);
- multimedia editing tools;
- application for creating web applications;
- application for editing code;
- application for exporting to web technology format (e.g. software for saving in HTML);
- application that generates content based on templates, scripts, command lines, etc.;
- application or functionality of a web page enabling the editing of portions of web pages or applications (typically, blog systems, comment features on websites, forums or wiki systems);
- mail application used to send e-mails.

Examples of editing tools that are not included in the scope:

- An application where the content created is not made available to other users (note-taking application with no sharing functionality, for example). In this case, the edited content is only available to the owner and is not made available to other users.
- Forms intended for users. For example, an order form for an e-commerce application. Although forms allow content to be edited, this content is not made available to other users.
- Independent accessibility control tools: these tools do not modify the content they control.

Editing tools should not be systematically included in the sample. For example, when auditing a news website, the RAWeb does not require the editing tool (e.g. a CMS) used to create the content to be audited. If the purpose of the audit is to evaluate the public consultation interface, the sample must contain only the representative public pages, but not the content management system.

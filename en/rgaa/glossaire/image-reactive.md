title: Image map
---

- Client-side image map (`usemap` attribute): image divided into clickable or neutral areas (`nohref` attribute);
- Server-side image map (`ismap` attribute): image for which the browser transmits the coordinates of the pointer to the server, each set of coordinates corresponding to a resource (web page). Server-side image maps are extremely rare.

Note: in HTML5, the `ismap` attribute is obsolete and non-compliant for `image` type buttons (`input type="image"`).

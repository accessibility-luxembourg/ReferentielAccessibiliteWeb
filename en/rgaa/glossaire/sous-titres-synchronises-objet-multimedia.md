title: Synchronised captions (media object)
---

Text of audio information (a character's words, noise that is important for understanding the action, etc.) present in a time-based medium and displayed synchronously with the flow of the multimedia object.

Note 1: to differentiate between audio sources (different characters, voice-over, etc.), it is recommended that an appropriate mechanism be used (bracketing, italics, explicit announcement such as "voice-over: ...").

Note 2: subtitling for translation (the `kind="subtitles"` attribute of the `<track>` tag in HTML5, for example) should not be confused with captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing (the `kind="captions"` attribute of the `<track>` tag in HTML5, for example). Subtitling and captioning serve different purposes. Only the presence and relevance of captions for the deaf and hard of hearing will ensure compliance.

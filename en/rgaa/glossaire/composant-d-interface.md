title: User interface component
---

A user interface component is an element with which the user can interact, for example a button, a link or an input zone. Some components can be more complex, such as a menu, a dialogue window or a tab system. Finally, a user interface component can be based on native HTML elements or developed from scratch using JavaScript and WAI-ARIA attributes. In particular, for elements with WAI-ARIA attributes corresponding to a [design pattern](#design-pattern) it is recommended to consider the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Authoring Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) document when implementing them.

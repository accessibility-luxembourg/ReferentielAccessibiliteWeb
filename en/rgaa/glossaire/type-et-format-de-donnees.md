title: Data type and format
---

Indication of the data type and format expected when entering a form input field. For example

- Date (dd/mm/yyyy);
- Amount in euros;
- Postcode (5 digits: e.g. 75001).

Important note: when the type of form input field offers an input mask, for example the `date` or `time` fields, the format indication is not necessary.

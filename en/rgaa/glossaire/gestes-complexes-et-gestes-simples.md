title: Complex and simple gestures
---

A simple gesture involves touching a single point on the screen. It can be a single press or click, a double press or click, or a long press.

A complex gesture can be both a gesture involving several points of contact on the screen (e.g. a gesture with two fingers on the screen to zoom in or out on a map) and a gesture based on following a particular path on the screen (e.g. a JavaScript function that detects the movement of a finger to the left or right on a tactile surface to trigger switching to the previous/next item in a carousel).

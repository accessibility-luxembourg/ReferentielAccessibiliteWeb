title: Navigation sequence
---

Order in which the focus moves (to the next element or to the previous element). The natural order is the one implemented in the source code. When it is modified using the `tabindex` attribute or using a JavaScript command, it is the modified order that is referred to.

Warning: when an element initiates a change in the page (change of context, management of hidden zones, addition of content, management of form fields, etc.), the element initiating the change must be activated in order to test the consistency of the navigation sequence.

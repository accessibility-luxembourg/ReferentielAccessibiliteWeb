title: Help with creating accessible content
---

Any feature available from a content editing interface, whatever the target format, which supports the author of the content in taking into account digital accessibility rules.

Help with creating accessible content can be an automatic assistance tool or documentation. Aids to content creation include 
- automatic or semi-automatic tests available from the editing functions;
- other automatic tools (a <i lang="en">chatbot</i>, for example);
- documentation explaining how to define accessibility properties for each content item;
- manual tests available from the editing functions to guide authors in detecting errors.

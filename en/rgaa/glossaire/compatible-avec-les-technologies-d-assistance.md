title: Compatible with assistive technologies
---

Content or feature must be compatible with assistive technologies and with the accessibility functions of browsers and other user agents via an accessibility API.

This concerns both the technology and its features and uses:

- The way in which web technology is used must be compatible with assistive technologies. This means that the way the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users of assistive technologies in the language(s) of the content;
- The technology runs natively in widely available user agents that are, themselves, compatible with accessibility (such as HTML and CSS) or with a widely available plug-in that is, itself, compatible with accessibility.

Verifying compatibility with assistive technologies requires carrying out a number of tests specific to the technology used, for example

- Checking the name, role, value, properties and changes of state of user interface components;
- Checking that a user interface component is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).

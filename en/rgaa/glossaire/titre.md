title: Heading
---

HTML element (`h` tag) with 6 levels of hierarchy (from `h1` for the most important heading to `h6` for the least important) or HTML element with WAI-ARIA `role="heading"` and `aria-level` attributes used to structure the information in web content.

Ensuring a strict hierarchy between the headings of a web page is good practice, but the presence of hierarchical jumps does not invalidate the criterion as long as this looser hierarchy remains consistent (a `<h3>` heading can come directly after a `<h1>` heading, for example). The headings hierarchy does not have to contain a `<h1>` heading. Although these practices are not encouraged, they do not invalidate the criterion.

Note: headings visually hidden via CSS are considered to be present and validate the {% crit 9.1 %}.

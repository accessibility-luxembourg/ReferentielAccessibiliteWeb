title: Reading direction
---

Indicates the reading direction of the document or a passage of text via the `dir` attribute, `dir="ltr"`, for example. The two recognised values are

- `ltr` (left to right) indicates a reading direction from left to right;
- `rtl` (right to left) indicates a reading direction from right to left.

Note: if there is no indication of reading direction via the `dir` attribute on the `html`, `body` element, or one of the parents of the text being analysed, the default reading direction is left to right (value `ltr`).

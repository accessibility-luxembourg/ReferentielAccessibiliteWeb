title: Mechanism for enabling an accessibility feature
---

User interface component or set of user interface components used to activate a functionality that takes into account one or more adaptation needs of the interface. For example: a button for displaying a page with the correct contrasts, or a button for increasing paragraph spacing.

We also talk about a **set of components** when, in certain interfaces, the component that enables the functionality to be activated is only made available after one or more other components have been activated. For example: a button can be used to display a modal window which itself contains a button which can be used to display a page with conforming contrasts. In this case, the button that displays the modal window **and** the button that activates the display of compliant contrasts together constitute the mechanism.

This mechanism must maintain the same content and functionality as the site or page it modifies.

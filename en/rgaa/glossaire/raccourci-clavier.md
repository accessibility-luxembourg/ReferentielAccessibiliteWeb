title: Keyboard shortcut
---

A means of triggering an action associated with a user interface component by pressing one or more keys.

Note: "Access keys" (HTML `accesskey` attribute) are indeed keyboard shortcuts, but they are not affected by {% crit 12.10 %} insofar as their activation already requires the use of modifier keys (which vary depending on the browser).

title: Viewing control (time-based media)
---

Possibility for the user to control the viewing of time-based media by means of the keyboard and any pointing device, at least. The following points must be respected:

- List of mandatory features for controlling consultation
  - The multimedia object must always have at least the following functions: play, pause or stop;
  - If the multimedia object has sound, it must have a sound on/off function;
  - If the multimedia object has subtitles or captions that are not embedded, it must have a function for controlling the appearance / disappearance of the subtitles or captions;
  - If the multimedia object has audio description, it must have a function for controlling the appearance / disappearance of the audio description.
- Each feature must be accessible from the keyboard, via the tab key, and by any pointing device at least.
- Each feature must be activatable via the keyboard and by at least one pointing device.

Note: if there is no sound in a time-based medium, there is no point in adding a sound activation/deactivation function. If, however, this functionality is present and requires a text alternative to be understood by certain users, then it should be given one since the user is likely to access it and want to activate it.

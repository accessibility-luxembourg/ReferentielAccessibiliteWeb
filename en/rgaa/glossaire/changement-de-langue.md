title: Language change
---

Indicating language changes is necessary to tell assistive technologies to modify the speech output of an element. Language changes affect all content, including the values of certain attributes such as `title`.

Note: it is not possible to indicate language changes in an attribute value itself, in which case the language change is indicated on the element containing the attribute. For example, a link with a `title` in French must include a `lang="fr"` attribute. When the attribute contains several passages of text in different languages, the criterion is not applicable.

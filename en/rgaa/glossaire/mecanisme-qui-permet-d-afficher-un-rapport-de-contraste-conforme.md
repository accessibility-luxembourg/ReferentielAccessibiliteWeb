title: Mechanism for displaying a compliant contrast ratio
---

A user interface component whose activation allows the appearance of the site or page to be modified so that content is displayed with a sufficient contrast ratio. The design of this user interface component must comply with {% crit 3.2 %} and {% crit 3.3 %} without itself using a mechanism to display a compliant contrast ratio. This mechanism must maintain the same content and functionality of the site or page that it modifies.

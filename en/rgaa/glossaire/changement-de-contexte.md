title: Changes of context
---

Major changes in the content of a web page which, if made without the user being aware of them, can disorientate the user who cannot see the whole page at once. Changes of context include changes of:

- user agent;
- viewport;
- focus;
- content that modifies the meaning of the web page.

Note: A change in content is not always a change of context. A change in content, such as the expansion of a tree structure, a dynamic menu or a tab move, does not necessarily change the context unless it also changes one of the elements listed above (the focus, for example).

For example, opening a new window, moving the focus to a different component, moving to a new page (including anything that, to the user, would look like moving to another page) or significantly reorganising the content of a page are all examples of a change of context.

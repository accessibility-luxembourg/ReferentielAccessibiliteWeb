title: Correctly rendered (by assistive technologies)
---

When a criterion, test or test condition requires the rendering of a device to be checked, it must be ensured that the rendering is compatible with accessibility.

The test consists of verifying that the rendition is relevant for at least one of the combinations of the test environment (or "baseline") used to declare that an element, device or alternative is "compatible with accessibility".

For example: the {% test '1.3.8' %} asks you to check that the alternative of a bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) conveying information is correctly rendered.

A test is then carried out using the tools in the test environment defined for the site.

If it is found that the alternative is correctly rendered, the test is validated.

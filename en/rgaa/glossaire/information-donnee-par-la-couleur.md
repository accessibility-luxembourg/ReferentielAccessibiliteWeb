title: Information (provided by colour)
---

Information conveyed visually through colour. The indication that fields in red are mandatory in a form, the use of a blue background to indicate the page currently being consulted in a menu with a green background, the change of colour of an item name to indicate its unavailability in a list of items are all examples of information given by colour.

When information (provided by colour) is accompanied by another method aimed at users who cannot see or perceive colours or their associations well, the criterion will be considered as not applicable.

Means of conveying information other than by colour may be

- A visible text indication;
- Means involving graphics (pictogram, background image, shape, different border style, etc.) and through a complement to the code (`aria-label`, `title`, hidden text, `aria-current`, etc.);
- A different typographic style (bold, italic, text size, different font, etc.) and by means of a supplement in the code (`aria-label`, `title`, hidden text, `aria-current`, etc.).

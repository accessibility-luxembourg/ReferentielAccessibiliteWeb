title: Short and concise alternative
---

The conditions for rendering a text alternative using assistive technologies (e.g. a screen magnifier) require it to be as short as possible. A maximum length of 80 characters is strongly recommended; this will limit the number of manipulations required to read the alternative by users of Braille displays or screen magnifiers in particular.

title: Relay service
---

Relay services allow users, regardless of their mode of communication (text, sign, speech) to interact during real-time remote communication with other participants, by providing conversion between modes of communication.

For example, if a user who communicates using sign language wants to talk to someone who does not, a relay service will provide live interpreting so that they can communicate.

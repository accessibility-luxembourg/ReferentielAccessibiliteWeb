title: Complex data table
---

A data table is a structure introduced by a `<table>` tag or when it is correctly rendered by assistive technologies by a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="table"` attribute.

When a data table contains headers that are not distributed solely over the first row and/or column of the grid, or whose scope does not apply to the entire column or row, it is referred to as a complex data table. It is then necessary to provide a "summary" to explain its nature and structure in order to make it easier to consult for users of assistive technologies, for example.

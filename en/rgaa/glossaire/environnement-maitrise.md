title: Controlled environment
---

Any environment in which access to information, technologies, conditions of use and user profiles can be known and controlled. The main elements whose control is essential are

- Browser type and version;
- Supported technologies, their version and activation (JavaScript, WAI-ARIA, etc.);
- Assistive technologies and any devices used specifically by users with disabilities;
- Operating systems and accessibility APIs supported;
- Training for users of assistive technologies in the use of any specific device (interface, online application, etc.).

Authors and administrators must guarantee the compatibility of the technologies used and their use by users and their technologies (including assistive technologies). Information services or Websites, whatever their status, which offer public access cannot be considered controlled environments.

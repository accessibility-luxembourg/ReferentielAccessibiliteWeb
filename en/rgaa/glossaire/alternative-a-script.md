title: Alternative (to a script)
---

Text or process associated with the script by means of an appropriate technique and enabling a function or content similar to that offered by the script to be made available.

Note: when an alternative to a JavaScript process or functionality is proposed, the means of accessing it must be provided by the site itself. This may be a link or a button allowing access to an alternative page operating without JavaScript or allowing the component(s) to be replaced by an alternative component operating without JavaScript, for example.

title: Accessibility information
---

Accessibility information is all the information (attributes, programmatic relationships, alternatives, etc.) required to make content accessible. For example: the alternative of a graphic element, the semantics of a passage of text, the title of an iframe, etc.

For example, in HTML, the `alt` attribute of an image is accessibility information.

An editing tool should have functions that allow you to define all the information needed to create accessible content, for example

- defining the alternative of an image or, on the contrary, declaring it decorative;
- the ability to define section headings;
- define the language of a passage of text;
- define labels for form fields.

All the accessibility criteria relating to the content technology in question are concerned. For example, for an HTML page, all the RAWeb level A and AA criteria must be met. For the creation of a document in PDF format, all the criteria of the [PDF accessibility assessment framework (RAPDF)](../rapdf1/index.html) level A and AA must be met.

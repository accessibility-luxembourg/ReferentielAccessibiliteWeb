title: Alternative content
---

Content that replaces another providing the same information but may be presented in a different way. This content may be in text form, but it may also be implemented using tags. Alternative content must comply with all the RAWeb criteria applicable to it in order to be considered an accessible alternative to the element it replaces. Example: a data table can be the alternative content for a bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) displaying a statistical graph.

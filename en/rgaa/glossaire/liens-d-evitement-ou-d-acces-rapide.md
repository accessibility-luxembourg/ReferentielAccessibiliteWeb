title: Bypass or skip links
---

Links whose function is to allow navigation within the page (skip link, link to the search form or menu, etc.). These links can be used either to access an area of the page (quick access link) or to skip an area of the page (bypass link).

Note 1: A functional bypass or skip link is a link whose activation makes it possible to resume reading and keyboard navigation from the target of the link when using the browsers and assistive technologies selected in the test environment (or "baseline") of the audit.

Note 2: Bypass or skip links must be located at the same place in the presentation and in the same relative order in the source code in order to comply with {% crit 12.2 %}.

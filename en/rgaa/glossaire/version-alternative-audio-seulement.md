title: Alternative "audio only" version
---

An "audio only" version is an audio version, in the form of a simple file in MP3 format for example, used as an alternative to a video only (video without audio information). As the only users affected by accessibility are blind people, who cannot see the video, <abbr lang="en" title="web content accessibility guidelines">WCAG</abbr> considers it acceptable to offer an audio version as an alternative.

The "audio only" version must contain all the important visual information in the video.

It is generally easier to produce an audio version than a text version when the video is very descriptive (transcript often requires a great deal of editorial work). It should be remembered, however, that only a transcript provides universal access to the information in the video, in the event that a user is unable to launch the video, for example.

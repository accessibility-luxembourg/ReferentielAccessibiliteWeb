title: Error management (form)
---

A set of processes that warn the user of mandatory fields, expected type or format indications and input errors in a form. Error management can be implemented by the content author or be based on attributes (such as `required` or `pattern`), WAI-ARIA attributes (such as `aria-required`) or field types that automatically produce input or error indications (such as `url`, `email`, `date`, `time` types, for example).

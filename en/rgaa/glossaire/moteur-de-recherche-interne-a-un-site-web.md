title: Search engine (internal to a website)
---

Area giving direct access (form) or indirect access (interface element giving access to the form) to the search engine which enables searches to be made on the content of the entire site.

Note: Be careful not to confuse this search zone, which is unique on the site, with any other search engine that can be used, for example, to search a restricted part of the site: a catalogue, offers in a public procurement section, etc.

See the technical definition of search region provided by WAI-ARIA [`search(role)`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#search).

In a form, a set of fields which can be grouped together according to the nature of the information required. The purpose of grouping is to identify which fields should be treated as a whole.

Here are a few examples:

- Three successive fields for entering a date (day/month/year);
- Successive fields for a telephone number;
- A block for entering the user's identity and address, when the form contains several contact blocks;
- A set of radio buttons or tick boxes relating to a question.

These fields must be grouped together when the labels are not sufficient to inform the user that the fields are part of a group.

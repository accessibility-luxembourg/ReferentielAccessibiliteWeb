title: Clickable area
---

Region of a responsive image to which an action has been associated; for example, triggering an event by clicking on a link (for a client-side clickable area: `<area>` tag with the `href` attribute). The `<area>` tags are contained in the `<map>` tag.

For server-side image maps, the coordinates are held on the server.

title: Non-time-based media
---

Content that does not take place in time, which can be viewed using `svg` and `canvas` elements; for example, an interactive animation created using a `canvas` tag. Non-time-based media can contain time-based media (for example, a slideshow created with `canvas` which offers a list of videos to view).

title: Key features of captions

---

It is possible to apply presentation effects to captions (text colour, style, font) in order to convey information to users (e.g. identify the person speaking). These key features of captions are essential for users to understand them and should be retained during the transformation process (sending or recording the video, for example) if they are present.

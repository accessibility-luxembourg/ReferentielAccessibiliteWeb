title: Modify or cancel data and carried out actions
---

Procedures by which a user can modify the data they have entered, have their entry cancelled or have the actions resulting from their entry cancelled, for example cancelling an order or a bank transfer.

Note: The page containing a form which modifies or deletes data, or which transmits answers to a test or examination, or whose validation has financial or legal consequences, must explicitly indicate the period during which the user can request the cancellation of their input. It must also contain the procedure for cancelling the entry. This procedure does not have to be available online, although it is recommended.

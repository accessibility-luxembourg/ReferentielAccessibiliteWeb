title: Transformation
---

Process managed automatically by the editing tool. There are two types of transformation:

- content restructuring: transformation during which the input format (e.g. HTML, XML...) is the same as the output one, the restructuring only modifies elements of the markup. For example: linearising a table, dividing a document into several pages.
- content recoding: transformation during which the input format is different from the ouput one (e.g. HTML to XHTML, HTML to PDF). This applies in particular to editing zones that use a different syntax from that which will be used for public display.
